This directory contains template files.  These files are templates in the sense
that new PPR source code files can be created by copying one of these files
and modifying it.  These files contain elements, such as copyright and
licensing notices, includes, and empty functions, which most source files
require.

main.c		A prototypical main module for a C program
module.c	A prototypical C module to me linked with a main module
main.perl	A prototypical Perl program
module.pl	A prototypical Perl library
