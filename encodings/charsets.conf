; This file is used to determine which PostScript encoding
; should be used to print documents which use a given
; character encoding scheme.
;
; The first field is the name of the character encoding as it
; should be fed to the charset= filter option.
;
; The second field is the PostScript name of the encoding vector
; which should be used.
;
; The third field indicates whether the encoding vector named
; the the second field calls for the correct ASCII glyphs at
; all of the ASCII character positions.
