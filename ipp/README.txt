This directory contains PPR's IPP server.

PPR will soon implement IPP 1.0 and 1.1 as well as the CUPS extensions.  It can
already work to some extent with many IPP clients intended for use with CUPS.
These include the CUPS command-line programs lp, lpr, lpq, lpstat, etc., as
well as KDE's printing subsystem, Openoffice.org, and Mozilla.
