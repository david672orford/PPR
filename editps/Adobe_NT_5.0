# This filter fixes the output of the Adobe PostScript driver version
# 5.0 for Microsoft Windows NT.
#
# This driver fails to close one of its file resources.  We add a 
# line to close it.
#
# Keep in mind that this edit script must work whether the driver
# is set to "optimize for speed" or to "optimize for portability".
#
# We also have the fix for the Acroread 6.x "ProcSet" vs. "procset"
# bug.  It has not yet been tested.
