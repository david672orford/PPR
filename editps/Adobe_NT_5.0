# This filter fixes the output of the Adobe PostScript driver for
# Microsoft Windows NT.  The 5.0 is the version number of the driver,
# not the version number of NT.
#
# This driver fails to close one of its file resources.
#
# Keep in mind that this edit script must work whether the driver
# is set to "optimize for speed" or to "optimize for portability".
