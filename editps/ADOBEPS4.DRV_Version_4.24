The Adobe 4.24 driver for Windows 95 sometimes emits a defective feature
block just inside the end of the prolog (not the docsetup).  Here is an
example:

%%BeginFeature: *Copies 1
 %%Empty Option
 %%EndFeature

=cut

while(<STDIN>)
    {
    s/ %%EndFeature/%%EndFeature/;
    print;
    }

exit 0;
