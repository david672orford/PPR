# This file is consulted by the uprint-* programs after they have
# failed to find the specified queue in any of the local spoolers.
# They search this file for a section having the name of the requested
# queue.  Each section contains information about a remote printer to
# which jobs can be sent using the lpr/lpd protocol described in RFC 1179.
#

# Here is a sample remote printer.  The remote system
# is running DEC OSF/1, so we turn on OSF protocol extensions.
#[theirprn]
#  remote host = somehost.somedomain.org
#  remote printer = spiffyprn
#  remote system type = osf

# Here is a sample configuration for sending to a computer
# running PPR's lprsrv.  Notice that the remote printer
# name is not specified.  Therefor it is the same as the
# section name, "myprn".
#[myprn]
#  remote host = someotherhost.somedomain.org
#  remote system type = ppr 1.40

# Here is a sample for sending to a system running Solaris 2.6.
#[otherprn]
#  remote host = sunhost.somedomain.org
#  remote system type = solaris 2.6

# This sends all unclaimed jobs to a remote system running
# RedHat Linux 5.2.
#[*]
#  remote host = penguin.somedomain.org
#  remote system type = redhat 5.2
