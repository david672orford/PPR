This directory contains the source code for PPR.  PPR is a print spooler for
PostScript printers.  The latest version of PPR may be obtained from:

	http://ppr-dist.trincoll.edu/pub/ppr/
	ftp://ppr-dist.trincoll.edu/pub/ppr/

The PPR home page is at:

	http://ppr.trincoll.edu/

See INSTALL.txt for detailed instructions on compiling and installing PPR and
information about upgrading from previous versions.

Post-install configuration instructions and a tutorial can be found in
docs/pprinst/pprinst.html or docs/pprinst/pprinst.ps.

Once PPR is installed, HTML versions of all the PPR documentation can be found
in the /usr/share/ppr/www/docs/ directory.  Man-style versions of some of the 
documents are also available.  You can either add PPR's man page directory 
(/usr/share/ppr/man) to your MANPATH or use the command "ppdoc" to read them.
