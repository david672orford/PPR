*% This PPD file solves some now forgotten problem with bin selection
*% on the QMS-PS 410.  I think maybe the problem was that the default
*% bin setting didn't affect jobs which used PageSize commands.  When
*% these commands are executed, the default tray is presumably the
*% current tray.  The substitute PageSize commands below see if the
*% current tray already has the requested medium size and if so, just
*% affirms that size instead of using the broken tray command for
*% that size.
