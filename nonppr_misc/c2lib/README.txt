~ppr/src/nonppr_misc/c2lib/README.txt
2 August 2003

This directory contains a stript-down version of c2lib 1.4.2.  The
original (complete with documentation and a test suite) may be obtained
from:

    http://www.annexia.org/freeware/c2lib/index.msp

It has been stript down by removing the build system, documentation, test
suite, matvec.*, added config.h (generated by the deleted system), and editing 
the files to find config.h in this directory.
