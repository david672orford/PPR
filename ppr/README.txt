This directory contains code for ppr which is the program used to submit
print jobs.

This directory also contains code for tbcp2bin, a helper program which is
called by ppr to decode files encoded with the Tagged Binary Communications
Protocol.

The files with names begining with "test" were at some point used for
informal tests during developement of the code in ppr_infile.c.
