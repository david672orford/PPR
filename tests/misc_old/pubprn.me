New Printing Facility for Students

For several years now, Trinity has provided its students with laser printers
with which to print their papers.  In order to use this facility, it was
necessary to copy the document onto a floppy diskette and carry it to a
computer in the printing room.

Since the the public computing rooms were connected to the campus network, it
has  been technically possible to allow students to send their documents
directly to the printers, over the network.  However, we have not allowed this
since it was feared that if printing were made too easy, then the printers
would be overused.

The inconvenience of saving the document on a diskette and carrying it to
another room is thought to discourage the printing of unnecessary draft copies.
Unnecessary printing is a serious problem since it takes a tremendous toll on
the printers and wastes a staggering amount of paper.  This system is not
perfect, though.  When many students have papers due, the lines often stretch
out of the printing room and down the hall.

This printing system with its "regulation through nuisance" will remain in
place for the time being, but the Computing Center staff is working on a new
printing system.  The goals in designing the new system, are to reduce the
inconvenience and delay for persons who are making proper use of the printers,
and to prevent persons who have no right to use the colleges facilities from
doing so.  Serious consideration is also being given to charging students for
each page printed on Computing Center laser printers.

The new printing system, as it currently stands, works like this:  A student
composing a document on one of the Machintosh personal computers in MCEC may
choose the word processor's print option.  When he does so, a box pops up on
the screen.  This box asks for the student's name.  When the name has been
entered, the personal computer transmits the name and the document to the
print and file server called "zep.serve".  The print server examines the name
which the student entered and makes sure that it is the name of a person
who has a right to use the printing facilities (i.e. a student, faculty or
staff member).  If the person is authorized, then the document is printed.  If
the person is not authorized, then the document is not printed.

The printer on which the document is printed is in the consultant's office. An
extra page is added at the start of each document.  On this page, in large
letters, is the name of the person who printed the document. A consultant will
take the document from the printer, look at the name on the banner page, and
file it in a rack which is on the wall just outside the
consultant's office.  The rack has a number of spaces with letters of the
alphabet written above them.  The document is filed in the box with the
initial letter of the student's last name.  The student may then get up from
his seat in the computer room, step across the hall, and take his document
from the rack.
.pp
Some improvement are still in order.  At present, there is no way to be sure
that the person doing the printing is not using someone else's name.  Until
we devise a way of preventing this kind of imposture, persons may continue
to gain unauthorized access to the college's printing facilities and it
will not be possible to bill students for their use of the printers.
The computing center staff will continue to investigate possible ways
of closing this loophole.  Even with this flaw, the new system is no worse
than the old and is much more convenient for the students, so we intend to make
our experimental system available very shortly.
