mouse:~ppr/filters_typeset/README.txt
25 December 1999

In this directory I am attempting to create PPR filters for document languages
such as HTML, POD, and RTF.

The directory "pod" contains a parser for Perl .pod format.  It uses Lex
and Yacc.  Eventually I want this to produce output similiar to that
of sgmls.

The directory "Print" contains code which will someday be a Perl library
for TeX like typesetting.
