mouse:~ppr/filters_typeset/README.txt
5 March 2003

This directory contains fragments of code which I hope will someday be a
library for doing typeesing using the TeX algorithms.  I would like to use
it to create a filter which can convert XSL Formatted Objects to PostScript.
It was started about seven years ago in C++ but didn't get beyond the point
of a few sucessful tests.  The directory Print/ contains an aborted attempt
to convert the code to Perl.  I plan to convert it to Java and finish it
someday.
