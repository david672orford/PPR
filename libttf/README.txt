This directory contains a library for converting TrueType font files to
PostScript.

Actually it contains code that was removed from pprdrv, so it doesn't
work like a library ought, at least not yet.  The biggest problem is
that it calls fatal() if anything goes wrong.  I am working to fix that.

This library contains no global variables.  Use ttf_new() to get a void
pointer to an opaque data structure.  When you are done with it, use
ttf_delete() to destroy it.  All externally callable routines have
names begining with ttf_ and are in source files with names beginging
with ttf_.  A PostScript font file is generated by calling ttf_psout().
This routine takes 5 arguments: the object pointer, three output routines,
and the PostScript font type number desired.  The currently supported
values are 42 and 3.

For a simple example of how to use this library, see the program
ttf2ps in ../ttfutils.
