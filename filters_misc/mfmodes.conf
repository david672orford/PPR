# This file is used by ppad to determine the proper value for the mfmode= in 
# the default filter options for a printer or group.  The mfmode= setting is 
# used when converting TeX DVI files to PostScript.
#
# The format of this file file is very simple:
# Field 1:	product (with the parenthesis removed)
# Field 2:	modelname
# Field 3:	nickname
# Field 4:	resolution
# Field 5:	MetaFont mode
#
# The first 4 fields must match the information extracted from the PPD
# files.  The 5th field is the MetaFont mode to be used if all of the
# first 4 fields match.  Any of the first 4 fields may be an astrisk which
# indicates that any value should be considered a match.  Full shell
# wildcards are not supported at this time.
#
# What exactly is a MetaFont mode?  DVI files often call for the inclusion of
# fonts generated with MetaFont.  In order to generate good-looking bitmap
# fonts from the MetaFont outlines, MetaFont needs to know some things about 
# the physical characteristics of the print engine.  Such a set of facts for 
# a given model of printer is called its MetaFont mode.  These modes are 
# refered to by name.  When asked to generate a bitmap font, MetaFont will 
# look up the specified mode name in a file called a modes file.  Most TeX 
# distributions use the definitive modes file maintained by one K.Berry.  A 
# sample of K.Berry's modes file is distributed with PPR as 
# filters_misc/modes-3.3.mf.

# A Ghostscript driven printer might have the product string
