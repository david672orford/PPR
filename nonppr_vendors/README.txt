21 August 2003

This subdirectory contains files on which are not covered by the PPR license
terms and which are not necessary to the operation of PPR.  It includes these
catagories:

1) PPD files which Adobe or a printer's manufacturer has provided.

2) A TrueType renderer for 68000-based level 1 PostScript printers.

3) AFM files which font vendors have provided for use with their fonts.

4) Fonts which vendors have provided for free distribution.

The license terms on these items vary.  For specifics, look for comments at the
tops of the files and for README files in the various directories.

For more information on the PPR license and 3rd party code and documents,
see ../LICENSE.txt and ../nonppr/README.txt.
