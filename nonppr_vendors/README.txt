mouse:~ppr/src/vendors/README.txt
12 September 2000

This subdirectory contains files on which are not covered by the PPR license
terms and which are not necessary to the operation of PPR.  It includes these
catagories:

1) PPD files which Adobe or a printer's manufacturer has provided.

2) Procedure sets extracted from the output of PostScript drivers.  PPR will
   sometimes download these when it is necessary to do so and the printer
   driver failed to.

3) AFM files which font vendors have provided for use with their fonts.

4) Fonts which vendors have provided for free distribution.

The license terms on these items vary.  For specifics, look for comments at the
tops of the files and for README files in the various directories.

For more information on the PPR license and 3rd party code and documents,
see ../LICENSE.txt and ../nonppr/README.txt.
