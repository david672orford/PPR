# This is installed in the root of the PPR web server.  Since a robots.txt
# file must be in the web server root directory to be effective, it will
# not work if a web server other than ppr-httpd is used to share the document
# and it presents them in a directory other than the root.
#
# I have created these exclusion rules because I thought it would be a bad
# thing if the search engines indexed everyone's private copy of the PPR
# documentation.
