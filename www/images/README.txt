mouse:~ppr/src/www/images/README.txt
23 January 2004

This directory contains both hand-build image files and FIG files from which
image files are automatically built during the build process.  (The file
fig2png does the actual conversion.)

Templates helpful in creating new images and FIG drawings for this directory
should be stored in ../images_src/.

Note that the images of the printers and groups in various states are not
here.  They are in ../q_icons/.
