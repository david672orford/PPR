<h2>Comment</h2>

<p>Use this tab to enter information describing the printer.  This
information is for human consumption.</p>

<p>The <b>Comment</b> is displayed by <tt>ppop destionation-comment</tt>.  It
also will be the comment for Samba shares.</p>

<p>The <b>Location</b> is the physical location of the printer.  A building
name or street address and room number would be good.  This information is
helps when dispatching repairmen.</p>

<p>The <b>Department</b> field can be used to indicate the department that
uses the printer.</p>

<p>The <b>Contact</b> field is for the name and telephone number or e-mail
address of a user of the printer.  The should be someone who works near the
printer.  When diagnosing problems, the system administrator may want to
call this person and suggest he clear paper jams or ask if the printer is
turned on.</p>

<h2>PPD</h2>

<p>A PPD file is a PostScript Printer Description.  In gives information
about how a specific PostScript printer differs from other PostScript
printers.  This information includes the list of available fonts, the list
of input trays, whether the printer can print in duplex, and the like.</p>

On the left you will see a list of the PPD files which are to be found in
<tt>/usr/share/ppr/PPDFiles</tt> on the print server.  The current PPD file
appears twice, once at its alphabetical location and once at the top of the
list.</p>

<p>If you do not find a PPD file that exactly matches you printer, you might
choose a PPD file for a similar model or an older model from the same
manufacturer.  Of course, it the best thing to do is the obtain the correct
PPD file and put it on the server.  Be sure you convert the line ending to
Unix style before you put it on the server.</p>

<p>On the right there is a table which gives a brief summary of the
information in the PPD file at the top of the list.</p>
