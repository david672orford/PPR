<h2>Comment</h2>

information is for human consumption.</p>

<p>The <b>Comment</b> is displayed by <tt>ppop destionation-comment</tt>.  It
also will be the comment for Samba shares.</p>

<p>The <b>Location</b> is the physical location of the printer.  A building
name or street address and room number would be good.  This information is
helps when dispatching repairmen.</p>

<p>The <b>Department</b> field can be used to indicate the department that
uses the printer.</p>

<p>The <b>Contact</b> field is for the name and telephone number or e-mail
address of a user of the printer.  The should be someone who works near the
printer.  When diagnosing problems, the system administrator may want to
call this person and suggest he clear paper jams or ask if the printer is
turned on.</p>

<h2>Interface</h2>

<p>On this screen you can select an interface program to be used for
communicating with the printer.  You can also specify an address which the
interface program should use when contacting the printer.  Finally, you can

<h2>RIP</h2>

<p>Here you can indicate that an external Raster Image Processor should be
used when printing PostScript job on this printer.  This can enable you to
print PostScript jobs on a printer that does not have an internal PostScript
interpreter.  Generally this RIP will be Ghostscript.</p>

<h2>PPD</h2>

<p>A PPD file is a PostScript Printer Description.  In gives information
about how a specific PostScript printer differs from other PostScript
printers.  This information includes the list of available fonts, the list
of input trays, whether the printer can print in duplex, and the like.</p>

<p>On the left you will see a list of the PPD files which are available on
the print server.</p>

<p>If you do not find a PPD file that exactly matches you printer, you might
choose a PPD file for a similar model or an older model from the same
manufacturer.  Of course, it the best thing to do is the obtain the correct
PPD file and put it on the server.  Be sure you convert the line ending to
Unix style before you puttin it in the /usr/share/ppr/PPDFiles directory on
the server (or in any other directory listed in the [PPD] section of
ppr.conf).  You should then run this command:</p>

<pre>
# ~ppr/bin/ppr-index ppds
</pre>

<p>On the right there is a table which gives a brief summary of the
information about the currently selected PPD file.</p>
