<h2>PPD</h2>

<p>A PPD file is a PostScript Printer Description.  In gives information
about how a specific PostScript printer differs from other PostScript
printers.  This information includes the list of available fonts, the list
of input trays, whether the printer can print in duplex, and the like.</p>

<p>On the left you will see a list of the PPD files which are available on
the print server.</p>

<p>If you do not find a PPD file that exactly matches you printer, you might
choose a PPD file for a similar model or an older model from the same
manufacturer.  Of course, it the best thing to do is the obtain the correct
PPD file and put it on the server.  Be sure you convert the line ending to
Unix style before you puttin it in the /usr/share/ppr/PPDFiles directory on
the server.  You should then run this command:</p>

<pre>
# ~ppr/bin/ppr-index ppds
</pre>

<p>On the right there is a table which gives a brief summary of the
information about the currently selected PPD file.</p>
