<ABSTRACT>
<PARA>
This is one of the four parts of the documentation for PPR version 1.50.  The
other parts are <CITETITLE>Installing and Using PPR</CITETITLE>,
<CITETITLE>The PPR Hackers Guide</CITETITLE>,
and the PPR man pages.
This part describes the construction and theory of operation of PPR.  It also
describes some of the more advanced features which <CITETITLE>Installing and
Using PPR</CITETITLE> ignores or gives scant attention.  While the man pages
provide the
definitive reference for the commands and programs, they do not attempt to
explain in detail why and how one would use any particular command or feature.
Nor do they discuss the internal workings of PPR.  These topics are what this
document is meant to cover.
Unfortunately, this document has never been finished.
</PARA>
</ABSTRACT>

<Sect1>
<Title>Introduction to PPR</Title>

<Para>
PPR is designed to operate printers which use page description languages
compatible with the PostScript language defined by Adobe Systems.  It is
true that a PostScript printer can generally be made to work with an
ordinary print spooler.  Enhancements, generally in the form of special
filters or interface programs, are available for both the System V LP
spooler and the Berkeley LPR spooler. However, these are generally rather
limited adaptations written to fulfill a pressing need, such as the need to
print banner pages. In order to fully exploit the more sophisticated
features of PostScript and the Adobe Document Structuring Convention, it
seemed best to start from scratch, writing a print spooler designed with
modern PostScript laser printers in mind.
</Para>

<Para>
It is one of the goals of this project to produce a print spooler which can
accept print jobs from many different types of computer systems
simultaneously.  This includes logged-in Unix users, MS-DOS and MS-Windows
users, Unix users on remote systems through the LPR/LPD protocol, and Apple
Macintosh computers.
</Para>

<Para>
The spooler is designed to provide services such as font and resource caching
which should reduce the time a Macintosh computer requires to generate and
transmit the print file.
</Para>

<Para>
On MS-DOS systems it is not always possible to adapt application programs to
generate PostScript directly.  For this reason, PPR has an automatic conversion
system which attempts to determine the format of an incoming document and
convert it to PostScript.  Filters are included to convert simple line printer
files as file inteneded for popular dot matrix printers.
</Para>

<Para>
PPR will read Adobe PostScript Printer Description (PPD) files in order to
obtain information about the printers under its control.  PPR will replace
specially marked code fragments in the document with the code fragments from
the PPD file.  Apple's LaserWriter 8 driver properly marks the relevent code
fragments.  If one uses Apple's LaserWriter driver version 8 or later it is
possible for a document to print correctly even if it is printed on a different
printer from that originally intended and the job uses special commands such as
those for bin selection.  It is also possible for an application to request
that PPR insert code fragments from the PPD file in order to invoke specific
features of the printer, such as duplexing or legal size paper.
</Para>

<Para>
PPR provides a mechanism whereby the operator specifies the size and type
of paper in each of a printer's bins.  When printing, users will request the
desired paper.  Print jobs will be held back until the operator changes the
paper and indicates to the spooler that he has done so.  If a job is being
held back for this reason, the names of the types of media required will be
indicated in the queue listing.  When the document is printed, PPR will
insert code to select the input tray which holds the desired medium.
</Para>

<Para>
Where the printer and its interface support it, PPR will capture PostScript
error messages resulting from the execution of a job and put them in a log
file which may be printed on the banner or trailer page or later viewed by the
user.  If a PostScript error occurs during the printing of a job, that job is
held in the queue so that it may be examined to determine the reason for the
failure.
</Para>

<Para>
PPR can detect printer malfunctions and deal `intelligently' with
them.  If problems persist, it will inform an operator.
</Para>

<Para>
It is desireable that PPR be able to reliably identify the users on
various computer systems, employing passwords when necessary, so that users
can be made to pay for their use of the printers.  Unfortunately, the necessary
client-side software is not always available.
</Para>

<Para>
PPR can maintain a list of user accounts, each of which contains money. When
PPR prints a job for a user on a printer which has a per page charge, PPR
computes the number of sheets of paper used and deducts the corresponding
amount of money from the user's account. The system administrator may set a
credit limit for each user. When the credit limit is exceeded, PPR will refuse
to accept more jobs for the user.
</Para>

<Para>
PPR can convert a document for N-Up printing, thereby saving paper.  It
can also convert many documents to signatures or booklets.
</Para>

</Sect1>

<Sect1>
<Title>A Brief Note On Terminology</Title>

<Para>
This document describes a complete system which accepts print jobs, places
them in a queue, and prints them as soon as it becomes possible. This printing
system is called ``PPR''.  Unix users submit jobs to this system by means of a
program called ``<Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis>''.  Unfortunately, in discussing this system it is
possible to confuse the two.  This document attempts to ease that confusion by
refering to the two in slightly different ways.  When the spooling system as a
whole is meant, it is refered to simply as ``PPR'', in all upper case.  When
the program users employ to submit jobs to PPR is meant, it is refered to as
<Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> in all lower case and bold face.  Further, the program for submitting
jobs will frequently be refered to as, ``the program <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis>''.
</Para>

</Sect1>

<Sect1>
<Title>Core PPR Components and How They Work Together</Title>

<Para>
This section describes the subprograms which comprise the core of PPR and
the r&ocirc;le of each.
</Para>

<Sect2>
<Title>How Jobs Enter the Queue</Title>

<Para>
All jobs which enter the queue pass through the program called
``<Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis>''.  This is true even of those which pass first through the
Macintosh print server, the LPR compatible server, or Samba.  (These additional
server components will be described later.)  The program <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> reads a
PostScript file and splits it into 3 files.  These three files are placed in a
spool directory and a fourth file, called the queue file, is created which
describes the job and the options the user has selected.  Once all the files
are ready, <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> sends a message to the print daemon, which is called,
``<Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis>'', telling it that a new job is in the queue.  This process is
illustrated in figure <XRef LinkEnd="pprdoc-enter">.
</Para>

</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>How Jobs are Printed</Title>

<Para>
When <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis> determines that the time has come to print a file on a printer,
it invokes a program called <Emphasis remap="bf">pprdrv</Emphasis> which reads the 3 job files and
reasembles them into a PostScript file.  While doing so it will consult
information read from the printer configuration file and the queue file and
a PostScript Printer Description (PPD) file.  It may also include fonts and
other resources in the data stream.  This process is illustrated in figure <XRef LinkEnd="pprdoc-printing2">.  (The inclusion of fonts and other resources has been
ommited from the figure for the sake of simplicity.)

<Graphic FileRef="pprdoc-printing1">
</Figure>
</Para>

<Para>
The program <Emphasis remap="bf">pprdrv</Emphasis> sends the file to the printer by invoking an interface
program.  It is the responsibility of the interface program to accept the print
job on standard input, send it the printer, if possible receive any error
messages, and pass them back to <Emphasis remap="bf">pprdrv</Emphasis> by writing them to stdout.
</Para>

<Para>
Notice in figure <XRef LinkEnd="pprdoc-printing1"> that printing is taking place on
``PRINTER 1'' and ``PRINTER 3''.
</Para>

<Para>
``PRINTER 2'' is idle, so the processes necessary to print on it are shown
with dotted line boxes, indicating that they do not exist at present.
</Para>

<Para>
Once the job has been printed, the interfaces program exits, after which
<Emphasis remap="bf">pprdrv</Emphasis> exits.  The main spooling daemon, <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis> detects this and
removes the job from the queue and attempts to inform the user that the job is
done.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Job Errors</Title>

<Para>
When exiting, <Emphasis remap="bf">pprdrv</Emphasis> will indicate to <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis> that printing was
successful or that it was not.  If <Emphasis remap="bf">pprdrv</Emphasis> indicates that a problem occured
which was caused by the particular job being printed, a PostScript error for
instance, then the job is placed in the ``arrested'' state, the user who
submitted it is informed, and <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis> looks for another job to print on that
printer.  The ``arrested'' state is a special case of the ``held'' state.  An
arrested job remains in that state until it is canceled or released.
</Para>

<Para>
When a job is arrested, the user who submitted it is informed, however if
the arrested job is subsequently deleted by an operator, the user will not
be informed as he would be if a normal job of his were canceled.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2 id="printer-errors">
<Title>Printer Errors</Title>

<Para>
If <Emphasis remap="bf">pprdrv</Emphasis> indicates that the problem is with the printer, then the job
is returned to the queue, the printer is placed in fault mode, and <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis>
looks for another printer on which to print the job.  When <Emphasis remap="bf">pprdrv</Emphasis>
discovers a problem with a printer, it indicates to <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis> whether or not it
is a problem from which the printer is likely to recover without the
intervention of the system operator.  Problems from which it is likely to
recover on its own include those which are transient or which an ordinary user
might correct, such as printer-turned-off and out-of-paper.  If the problem is
one from which the printer may recover, then it is placed in fault-retry mode;
if it is not expected to recover, it is placed in fault-no-retry mode.
</Para>

<Para>
In fault-retry mode, <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis> tries to restart the printer at intervals.  The
delay before the retry is 10 seconds the first time and increases by 10 seconds
after each failure until the interval reaches about 10 minutes, at which point
it does not continue to increase.  In fault-no-retry mode, the printer is not
restarted until a system operator restarts it.  An operator may restart a
printer with the command <Emphasis remap="bf">ppop start printer</Emphasis>.
</Para>

<Para>
When <Emphasis remap="bf">pprdrv</Emphasis> detects a printer fault, it writes a description of it to a
file in the <Literal remap="tt">alerts</Literal> directory, a file which is named after the
printer.  At intervals, <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis> may send the contents of this file to a
system operator.  The interval is defined in the printer configuration file.
The interval is expressed as ``every <Emphasis remap="it">n</Emphasis> faults''.  If the interval is set
to 1, the alerts log is sent after each printer fault; if the interval is set
to 5, the alerts log is sent after every 5th printer fault.  If the interval is
set to 0, the alerts are never sent.
</Para>

<Para>
If the alert interval is negative, it is treated differently.  First of all,
the absolute value is used as the alert interval.  Second, the alerts are
only sent to the system operator once.  Third, a notice is sent to the
system operator if the printer sucessfully prints a job after incurring at
least abs(<Emphasis remap="it">n</Emphasis>) alerts.
</Para>

<Para>
Each time a fault occurs, the alert message is appended to the alert log. The
exception is that if the previous alert occured more than one hour previously,
the alert log is truncated to zero length and a new one started.  Whether or
not the alerts have been dispatched to an operator, the alert log may be read
at any time with the command <Emphasis remap="bf">ppop alerts</Emphasis> <Emphasis remap="it">printer</Emphasis>.
</Para>

<Para>
It is in the printer configuration file that the alert interval is specified,
as well as the method by which alerts are to be dispatched and the address to
send them to.  A typical alert dispatch method (indeed, the only one supported
at this time) is ``mail''.  This means that the alerts are sent by electronic
mail to the indicated address.  The alert parameters may be set with the
<Emphasis remap="bf">ppad alerts</Emphasis> command.
</Para>

</Sect2>

</Sect1>

<Sect1>
<Title>Printers and Groups of Printers</Title>

<Para>
When printing a document with PPR it is necessary to specify a set of one
more more printer on which it may be printed.  If you specify the name of a
printer, PPR will print the document on that printer if it determines that the
printer has the necessary capabilities.  If you indicate a group of printers to
print the document on, PPR will print the document on the first available
printer with the necessary capabilities.  Both printers and groups are
identified by name.  A printer or group name may be up to 16 characters long
and may contain any printable characters except, slash (``/'').  It also must not
begin with tilde (``&nbsp;'') or period (``.'').
</Para>

<Para>
Each printer is described by a printer configuration file in the directory
<Literal remap="tt">/etc/ppr/conf/printers</Literal>.  Each group is defined by a group
configuration file in the directory <Literal remap="tt">/etc/ppr/conf/groups</Literal>.  The format
of a printer configuration file is described in Appendix <XRef LinkEnd="printer-config"> and the format of
a group configuation file is described in Appendix <XRef LinkEnd="group-config">.  The desired printer or
group may be specified with the <Emphasis remap="bf">-d</Emphasis> switch to the <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> command.  If the
<Emphasis remap="bf">-d</Emphasis> switch is ommited, <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> takes the printer or group name from the
environment variable ``PPRDEST''.  If PPRDEST is not defined, <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> attempts
to send the job to a printer or group called ``default''.
</Para>

</Sect1>

<Sect1>
<Title>Accepting Jobs From a Network</Title>

<Para>
Users on the machine running PPR can submit jobs simply by running the
program <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis>.  But, when the user is on a remote machine connected by a
network to the machine with the PPR spooler, things get a little more
complicated.
</Para>

<Para>
Accepting network jobs requires a daemon process which waits new connexions.
When it receives a connexion, it must launch a server process.  The server
process will accept the print job and run <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> to submit it.
</Para>

<Para>
Often, the user on the remote computer will not have an account on the computer
that is running PPR.  Therefor, the server process must run <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> under some
system user ID.  This system ID may be ``ppr'' or any user listed in
<Literal remap="tt">/etc/group</Literal> as a member of the group ``pprprox''.  The system user will
invoke <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> with switches such as <Emphasis remap="bf">-f</Emphasis>, <Emphasis remap="bf">-X</Emphasis>, and <Emphasis remap="bf">--charge-to</Emphasis>.
These switches will indicate that the system user is submitting the job on
behalf of a user on a remote machine.
</Para>

<Para>
The <Emphasis remap="bf">-f</Emphasis> switch sets the name of the user who submitted the job.  This name
will appear in queue listings and on banner and trailer pages.
</Para>

<Para>
The <Emphasis remap="bf">-X</Emphasis> switch is used to provide a string which uniquely identifies the
user on the remote machine.  Generally, this string will be the user's name on
the remote machine, followed by an ``@'', followed by the network address of the
remote machine.
</Para>

<Para>
The <Emphasis remap="bf">--charge-to</Emphasis> switch is useful when using the charge accounts which can
be set up with <Emphasis remap="bf">ppuser</Emphasis>.  If the argument of the <Emphasis remap="bf">-f</Emphasis> switch is the
user's real name, the <Emphasis remap="bf">--charge-to</Emphasis> switch can be used to specify a more
cryptic account name to which the cost of printing printing should be charged.
</Para>

<Sect2>
<Title>Accepting Jobs From Macintoshes</Title>

<Para>
PPR provides a daemon called <Emphasis remap="bf">papsrv</Emphasis> which acts as a Macintosh print
server.  It accepts connexions from Macintosh clients, answers queries using
information in the PPD files, and accepts jobs.  Whenever <Emphasis remap="bf">papsrv</Emphasis> accepts a
connexion from a Macintosh, it forks a copy of itself to service the connexion.
When the child daemon receives a print job, it launches <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> on the end of a
pipe to process it.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Accepting Jobs Using the LPD Protocol</Title>

<Para>
PPR provides a daemon called <Emphasis remap="bf">lprsrv</Emphasis> which can be launched by the internet
super daemon, Inetd.  The daemon <Emphasis remap="bf">lprsrv</Emphasis> implements the Berkeley LPD protocol.
</Para>

<Para>
When a print job is received, <Emphasis remap="bf">lprsrv</Emphasis> checks to see if the destination
specified matches the name of any PPR printer or group.  If it does, <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> is
invoked to accept the job.  If not, the job is fed to the system's default spooler
through the <Emphasis remap="bf">lp</Emphasis> or <Emphasis remap="bf">lpr</Emphasis> command.  No configuration file is required for
<Emphasis remap="bf">lprsrv</Emphasis>.  All PPR printers as well as all the printers belonging to the
normal system spooler are automatically made available.
</Para>

<Para>
However, unless inetd invokes <Emphasis remap="bf">lprsrv</Emphasis> with the <Emphasis remap="bf">-p</Emphasis> (permissive) switch, it
will only accept jobs from machines listed in <Literal remap="tt">/etc/hosts.equiv</Literal> or
<Literal remap="tt">/etc/hosts.lpd</Literal> which are also not listed in
<Literal remap="tt">/etc/hosts.lpd&lowbar;deny</Literal>.  (It is also ok to list a whole domain in these
files.  Any name begining with a period is interpreted as a domain name.)
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Accepting Jobs From a LAN Manager For Unix Server</Title>

<Para>
AT&amp;T's LAN Manager for Unix can invoke a print processor script when a
job is received for a certain printer.  PPR provides a print processor script
which submits the job using the <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> command.  If the directory
<Literal remap="tt">/var/opt/lanman/customs</Literal> exists when PPR is installed, then the script
is installed as <Literal remap="tt">/var/opt/lanman/customs/ppr</Literal>.  While it is possible to
prepare several versions of this script to invoke <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> with various
options, it will probably prove more convenient to use the <Emphasis remap="bf">ppad switchset</Emphasis>
or <Emphasis remap="bf">ppad group switchset</Emphasis> command (depending on whether it is a printer of a
group) to store the desired switches in the printer or group's configuration
file.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Accepting Jobs From a Samba Server</Title>

<Para>
The free Unix file and print server Samba has a very flexible printing system.
The print command for any given print queue can be specified in Samba's
configuration file.  The Samba server sends jobs to PPR by writing the job to a
temporary file and then invoking <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis>.  The <Emphasis remap="bf">-U</Emphasis> switch should be used to
tell <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> to delete the temporary file once it is done reading it.  It is
advisable to append ``&amp;'' to the print command because for very large files
which must be filtered, the client will time out before <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> exits.  Sample
Samba print commands are given in the man page ppr2samba(8).
</Para>

</Sect2>

</Sect1>

<Sect1>
<Title>Identifying Users</Title>

<Para>
It is often necessary to identify the user who submitted a job.  In the case
of
a printer which is shared by may users, a banner page giving the user's name may
be required.  It is also helpful in queue listings to identify the submitting
user
of each job.  When it is desired to restrict printing privledges or to charge
for
printing, passwords may be in order.
</Para>

<Para>
Because PPR accepts print jobs from many different kinds of computer systems it
employs several techniques for determining and verifying the identity of users.
Basically, PPR has two user validation modes.  The first is called system
validation mode.  In system validation mode, PPR assumes that since the user
gained access to the system and managed to execute <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> he must be
authorized.  In system validation mode security efforts are concentrated on
preventing the user from disguising his identity to avoid printing charges.  The
other validation mode is authorization code validation mode.  In that mode, an
authorization code (password) is embedded in the job as a PostScript comment or
communicated using a special protocol.  Such a password scheme is advisable when
the jobs are arriving over an unsecured channel, such as an AppleTalk or LAN
Manager network.
</Para>

<Para>
The means by which the user name is determined depends on the validation mode.
In
system validation mode, is the user name of the user who invoked <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis>,
unless
the user is ``ppr'', ``root'', or a member of the group ``pprprox''.  These are
privledged users who may accept jobs over the network on behalf of remote users.
</Para>

<Para>
When a privledged user is submitting a job on behalf of another, the name may
be supplied with <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis>'s <Emphasis remap="bf">-f</Emphasis> switch.  A privledged user may also use the
<Emphasis remap="bf">-R for</Emphasis> switch to indicate that <Emphasis remap="sf">&percnt;&percnt;For:</Emphasis> lines in the
input file are to be scanned for the user name.  Of course, if the privledged
user employs none of these options then the job will be identified as belonging
to the privledged user who submitted it.
</Para>

<Para>
The name that the privledged user supplies with the <Emphasis remap="bf">-f</Emphasis> switch will often
be a `real name' such as ``Joseph Andrews''.  If printer charge accounts use
a shorter name such as ``jandrews'' then the <Emphasis remap="bf">--charge-to</Emphasis> option will be
used to indicate that name.  In that case, the privledged user might invoke
<Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> like this:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
$ ppr -d thatprn -f "Joseph Andrews" --charge-to jandrews
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
There must also be some mechanism to make sure that a user can't delete another
user's jobs.  For that reason it is necessary to unambiguously identify each
remote user from which a privledged user accepts jobs.  The privledged user
uses the <Emphasis remap="bf">-X</Emphasis> switch to inform <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> of this identification.  So, the
command above would become:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
$ ppr -d thatprn -f "Joseph Andrews" --charge-to jandrews -X jandrews@somehost.someorg.org
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
This will allow PPR to subsequently distinguish between identically named users
on different hosts without choking up the queue listings and banner pages with
a level of detail which is generally unnecessary.  The <Emphasis remap="bf">-X</Emphasis> switch is often
referred to as the ``proxy-for'' switch for reasons which I hope are obvious.
</Para>

<Para>
In authorization code validation mode, the user name is the one specified in
the PostScript <Emphasis remap="sf">&percnt;&percnt;For:</Emphasis> line, or if the
<Emphasis remap="sf">&percnt;&percnt;For:</Emphasis> line is absent, it is the name specified with the
<Emphasis remap="bf">-f</Emphasis> switch.  If both are absent, it is the name of the user who invoked
<Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis>.  In authorization code validation mode, the document must contain a
PostScript comment with the correct authorization code.  If it does not, the
job will be canceled and the user will be informed.
</Para>

<Para>
The use name and authorization code may be specified like this:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
%%For: smith
%TCHCTAuthCode: abr9yg
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
Authorization code validation mode is selected with <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis>'s <Emphasis remap="bf">-a</Emphasis> switch.
</Para>

</Sect1>

<Sect1>
<Title>Banner and Trailer Pages</Title>

<Para>
When many people will be using a printer it is sometimes desirable to
identify each print job with an extra page on which appears the name of the
person who sent it as well as other information such as the name of the
application which generated it and a job title.  PPR is capable of printing
banner pages as well as trailer pages.
</Para>

<Para>
When a user submits a print job he may request or reject a banner page and
request or reject a trailer page.  However PPR considers the user's request as
a suggestion only, making its final descision based on the user's suggestion,
and the configuration of the printer.
</Para>

<Para>
If bins are defined for the printer, the suitability of the printer's mounted
forms for printing banner pages is also a factor.  When printing a banner page,
PPR will use the currently mounted medium with the highest suitability rating.
If all mounted media have a suitability rating of 1, no banner or trailer pages
can be printed.  If bins are defined for the printer and media is mounted, PPR
will adjust the size, shape, and character size of the banner page to suit the
medium (paper type) being used.
</Para>

<Para>
If no bins are defined, the banner page will be formated for 8.5 by 11 inch paper
(or whatever "default medium =" is set to in the &lsqb;internationalization] section
if <Literal remap="tt">/etc/ppr.conf</Literal>), but no attempt will be made to
select a specific input tray or to request a specific page size of the printer.

<Para>
PPR can keep a running log of jobs printed.  To enable this logging, create
an empty file <Literal remap="tt">/var/spool/ppr/logs/printlog</Literal>.  One line will be appended
to this file for each job which is successfully printed.
</Para>

<Para>
Note:  prior to version 1.30, the printlog file format was different.  Two
digits, representing the seconds were added to the time stamp (in the first
field). Also, fields 5, 6, 7, and 9 were inserted between existing fields and
field 11 was added at the end.  The contents of the old fields did not change,
only the positions of some of them did.  Therefore, existing software will
have to be modified to use the new field numbering.
</Para>

<Para>
PPR releases since 1.30 have added new fields, so some of the fields at the end
may not be present in log files created by old versions of PPR.  You should keep
this in mind when writing software that parses this log file.

<ListItem>
<Para>
The 1st field is the date and time at which the job was submitted.  In
this case the date is November 15th, 1996.  The time is 1:14pm.
</Para>
</ListItem>

<ListItem>
<Para>
The 2nd field is the job id.  This job was submitted to the group
called ``rotate''.
</Para>
</ListItem>

<ListItem>
<Para>
The 3rd field is the printer it was printed on.  This job was printed on
the printer named ``chipmunk'' which is presumably a member of the group
``rotate''.
</Para>
</ListItem>

<ListItem>
<Para>
The 4th field is the name of the person who printed it.  This is the
name as it appeared in the queue listing and on banner pages.  This is a
quoted field.
</Para>
</ListItem>

<ListItem>
<Para>
The 5th field is the name of the Unix user who invoked <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> to
submit the job.
</Para>
</ListItem>

<ListItem>
<Para>
The 6th field is the argument to <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis>'s <Emphasis remap="bf">-X</Emphasis> switch, if it was
used.  In this case it wasn't used, so the field contains a string of
zero length.  This is a quoted field.
</Para>
</ListItem>

<ListItem>
<Para>
The 7th field is the number of logical pages in the job.  This ought
to be the number of <Emphasis remap="sf">&percnt;&percnt;Page:</Emphasis> comments in the PostScript
file.  If the number of pages is unknown this field will contain the value -1.
</Para>
</ListItem>

<ListItem>
<Para>
The 8th field is the number of sheets of paper used.  This job was
printed 4-Up in duplex mode so only one sheet was used.  If 5 copies had
been printed, this number would have been 5.
</Para>
</ListItem>

<ListItem>
<Para>
The 9th field is the number of actual pages (sides) printed.  Since this
job prints four reduced-size pages to an actual page, this field is 2.  If
5 copies had been printed, this field would have contained a 10.
</Para>
</ListItem>

<ListItem>
<Para>
The 10th field is the number of seconds which elapsed between the time
the job was queued and the time printing was completed.  (To be more precise,
the interval between when the program <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> was invoked and the time
<Emphasis remap="bf">pprdrv</Emphasis> wrote the log entry.)  This job was finished two minutes and 46
seconds after it entered the queue.
</Para>
</ListItem>

<ListItem>
<Para>
The 11th field is the number of seconds between the time <Emphasis remap="bf">pprdrv</Emphasis>
started up and the time if wrote the log entry.  It is expressed in seconds
and hundredths of a second.
</Para>
</ListItem>

<ListItem>
<Para>
The 12th field shows the amount of money charged.  This is a fixed point number
with two digits after the decimal point.  No monetary unit is indicated.
</Para>
</ListItem>

<ListItem>
<Para>
The 13th field shows the number of sides the printer says it printed.
This number will likely be obtained though HP PJL.  Note that at this time,
the value in this field is not used to compute the charge in the 12th field.
</Para>
</ListItem>

<ListItem>
<Para>
The 14th field reports the number of pages the printer claimed to have
printed over its lifetime.  This field is -1 if the number was not retrieved.
An attempt to retrieve it will only be made if the printer's configuration
file contains a ``PageCountQuery:'' line which enables this feature and the
<Emphasis remap="bf">feedback</Emphasis> setting is <Emphasis remap="bf">true</Emphasis>.  When this feature is enabled, the
page count is fetched just after printing the banner page and just before
printing the job itself.  If printing is sucessful, the resulting value will
ultimately be logged in the 14th field.
</Para>
</ListItem>

<ListItem>
<Para>
The 15th field is meaningful only if the value in the 14th field is
not -1.  Once the job has been printed, but before a trailer page is printed,
the page count query is repeated.  If the query is sucessful, then the
difference between the before and after page counts is logged in this field.
If the query is not performed or is not sucessful, then a -1 is loggged in
this field.  See the discussion of the ``PageCountQuery:'' line in
Appendix <XRef LinkEnd="printer-config">
for a discussion of why the value logged in this field may not accurately
reflect the number of pages printed.
</Para>
</ListItem>

<listitem>
<para>
The 16th field is the size of the PostScript job in bytes.  If the input file
was PostScript, then this is the size of the input file.  If the job had to be
converted to PostScript, then this is the size of the PostScript output of the
filter.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The 17th field is the number of bytes that were sent to the printer in order to
print this job.  This number may be significantly greater than the number in
field 16.  For example, it may have been necessary to print multiple copies by
sending the job several times or PPR may have inserted fonts into the job.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The 18th field is the title of the job.  If the job had no title, then the name
of the input file is used.  If there was no input file (such as if the job was
read from stdin), then this field will be blank.  This is a quoted field.
</para>
</listitem>

</ItemizedList>
</Para>

<Para>
If left uncontrolled, the printlog file will grow indefinitely, so steps should
be taken to truncate it regularly.
</Para>

</Sect2>

</Sect1>

<Sect1>
<Title>User Notification</Title>

<Para>
After a job has been printed, an attempt is made to inform the user.  The user
is also informed if a job is rejected, arrested, or canceled.  The agent which
performs the actual communication with the user is called a responder.  A
responder is a small program, generally a shell script, found in the
<Literal remap="tt">/usr/ppr/responders</Literal> directory.  No one responder will be appropriate
under all circumstances.  For instance, different responders are used to send
message to Unix shell users and Macintosh clients.
</Para>

<Para>
The responder to use is chosen when <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> is invoked.  It is chosen with the
<Emphasis remap="bf">-r</Emphasis> switch. If no  <Emphasis remap="bf">-r</Emphasis> switch is used, the default responder <Emphasis remap="bf">write</Emphasis> is
used.  If you wish to suppress user notification you should use the <Emphasis remap="bf">-m none</Emphasis>
switch.
</Para>

<Para>
Among its parameters the responder program is given an address to send the
message to.  The correct format for the address depends on the responder.  For
example, for the responder <Emphasis remap="bf">write</Emphasis> it is simply a Unix user name.  For the
responder <Emphasis remap="bf">mail</Emphasis> is it an electronic mail address.  For the responder
<Emphasis remap="bf">atalk</Emphasis> it is an AppleTalk network and node number seperated by a colon.
The address should be specified with the <Emphasis remap="bf">-r</Emphasis> switch when <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> is
invoked. If the <Emphasis remap="bf">-r</Emphasis> switch is ommitted, the default address, the name of
the user who is invoking ppr will be used.  This address is suitable for the
default responder, <Emphasis remap="bf">write</Emphasis>.  A list of the supplied responders may be found
in the ppr(1) man page in the section which describes the <Emphasis remap="bf">-m</Emphasis> switch.
Instructions for writing a responder are found in Appendix <XRef LinkEnd="responders">.
</Para>

<Para>
Additional responder options may be specified with <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis>'s
<Emphasis remap="bf">--responder-options</Emphasis> switch.  These options are a space separated list of
name=value pairs.  If no <Emphasis remap="bf">--responder-options</Emphasis> switch is used then the list
will be empty.
</Para>

<Para>
You can change the default responder, responder address, and responder options
by setting the environment variables PPR&lowbar;RESPONDER, PPR&lowbar;RESPONDER&lowbar;ADDRESS, and
PPR&lowbar;RESPONDER&lowbar;OPTIONS respectively.  For example, if you are using X-Windows,
you might want to add the following lines to your <Literal remap="tt">.xsession</Literal> file:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
# Authorize the PPR responder:
/usr/ppr/bin/ppr-xgrant

# Make the xwin responder the default:
PPR_RESPONDER=xwin
PPR_RESPONDER_ADDRESS=$DISPLAY
export PPR_RESPONDER PPR_RESPONDER_ADDRESS
</Screen>

</Para>

</Sect1>

<Sect1 id="progress-reporting">
<Title>Progress Reporting</Title>

<Para>
While a job is being printed, PPR queue listings will show how far along it
is.  Up to three figures are reported.  The first is the percentage of the file
which has been transmitted, the second is the number of the page which is
currently being transmitted (an ordinal with the first page transmitted
being one), the third is the number of pages which the printer reports it
has deposited in the output bin.  (The number of pages in the output bin
will only be reported if the jobbreak method is "pjl" or "signal/pjl".)
</Para>

<Para>
The data which <Emphasis remap="bf">ppop</Emphasis> uses to make these reports is deposited in the job's
queue file by <Emphasis remap="bf">pprdrv</Emphasis>.  It takes the form of a line that begins with
``<Emphasis remap="sf">Progress:</Emphasis>'' which <Emphasis remap="bf">pprdrv</Emphasis> appends to the queue file.  This line has
three numbers on it.  The first is the number of bytes written so far.  The
second is the number of <Emphasis remap="sf">&percnt;&percnt;Pages:</Emphasis> comments written so far.
The third number is the number of pages which the printer says it has dropt
into the output tray.  All three numbers are padded with leading zeros so that
as they increase their length does not change.
</Para>

<Para>
If the job is not printed sucessfully the first time, provided the
<Emphasis remap="sf">Progress:</Emphasis> line is still the last line in the file, <Emphasis remap="bf">pprdrv</Emphasis> does not
append a new line on the second and subsequent attempts, rather it overwrites
the old one.  If a queue file contains more than one <Emphasis remap="sf">Progress:</Emphasis> line, only
the last one should be accepted as correct.  Multiple <Emphasis remap="sf">Progress:</Emphasis> lines will
generally only be found if a <Emphasis remap="sf">Reason:</Emphasis>
<FOOTNOTE>

<Para>
A <Emphasis remap="sf">Reason:</Emphasis> line is
appended each time a job is arrested.
</Para>

</FOOTNOTE>
 line was appended after a
<Emphasis remap="sf">Progress:</Emphasis> line.
</Para>

<Para>
The percentage of the file transmitted, as reported by <Emphasis remap="bf">ppop</Emphasis>, is obtained
by dividing the number of bytes transmitted by the size of the origional
PostScript file and multiplying the result by 100.  The origional PostScript
file is the input file if it was PostScript or the output of the last filter in
the filter pipeline.  In some cases the percentage indicated when the job is
done is somewhat more or less than 100&percnt;. Causes such as the alteration
of DSC comments, the changing of line termination, and the insertion of feature
code will often make a difference of 1&percnt; to 5&percnt;.  The insertion of
procedure set such as the one for N-Up printing or the downloading of fonts can
result in a total transmission which is several times the size of the origional
file.  Occasionally a job will be printed which has large unnecessary
downloaded fonts.  If these are stript out the result will be that only a small
amount, say 20&percnt; of the job will be transmitted.  If switches such as
<Emphasis remap="bf">-s</Emphasis> or <Emphasis remap="bf">-p</Emphasis> are used to print only a portion of the job the total
percentage printed will be reduced accordingly.  All of these circumstances are
rare, however, so the total printed will almost always be within 5&percnt; of
the origional file size.
</Para>

</Sect1>

<Sect1 id="user-name-display">
<Title>PJL and User Name Display</Title>

<Para>
If your printer and interface support it and you use a jobbreak method of
<Emphasis remap="bf">pjl</Emphasis> or <Emphasis remap="bf">signal/pjl</Emphasis>, PPR will display the name of the user who
submitted the job being printed on the printer's display panel.
</Para>

<Para>
If you use PJL with a two-way communications channel to the printer, the printer
will report back whenever it drops a page into the output tray.  These messages
will be used to imcrease the detail of the progress information described in
section <XRef LinkEnd="progress-reporting">.
</Para>

</Sect1>

<Sect1 id="media-handling">
<Title>Media Handling</Title>

<Para>
Modern laser printers very often have multiple input trays.  At the same
time, version 3.0 of the Document Structuring Convention describes a
method whereby the type of medium required for each page in a job may be
specified.
</Para>

<Para>
When a job enters the queue, PPR attempts to determine what media types are
required to print it.  If the document contains comments which explicitly
indicate this, that information is used.  If not, PPR assumes that only one
type of medium is required and attempts to deduce what that is.  It starts
with a default medium.  The default medium is defined by "default medium ="
in the &lsqb;internationalization] section of <Literal remap="tt">/etc/ppr/ppr.conf</Literal>.  The
default medium should be US Letter or A4.  PPR then looks for comments in the
document setup section, such as <Emphasis remap="sf">&percnt;&percnt;PageSize:</Emphasis> comments and
invokations of the features <Emphasis remap="sf">*MediaType</Emphasis>, <Emphasis remap="sf">*MediaColor</Emphasis>, and
<Emphasis remap="sf">*MediaWeight</Emphasis>bf&#62; which would seem to indicate a different sort of medium.
Each time one of these comments is encountered PPR revises it idea of what
the required medium is like.
</Para>

<Para>
Once the characteristics of all the requested media are determined, PPR
attempts, for each one, to select a medium known to it that matches the
requirements.  The list of known types is stored in the file
<Literal remap="tt">/etc/ppr/media.db</Literal>.  For each required medium type, PPR makes
multiple passes over the known media list, relaxing its standards each time
until if finds a match.  If the proofmode is ``NotifyMe'' and PPR has to
relax its standards more than a little, it will reject the job.  The list of
known media types may be edited with the <Emphasis remap="bf">ppad media</Emphasis> commands.
</Para>

<Para>
For each printer the operator has the option of describing what known media type
is available in each bin or of forgoing automatic media handling entirely.  The
<Emphasis remap="bf">ppad bins</Emphasis> series of commands tells PPR what input bins are available.  If the
bin list is empty, PPR assumes that the printer can immediately print any job
queued for it, regardless of what media are required.  If the bin list is not
empty, PPR will not attempt to print a job until all the required media are
mounted on one or more bins.  In the case of a group, the job will be started on
the first member of the group which has the required media in place.
</Para>

<Para>
The operator must indicate what type of medium is in each bin by using the
<Emphasis remap="bf">ppop mount</Emphasis> command.  The media currently mounted on all the bins of a
printer or of a group may be seen by using the <Emphasis remap="bf">ppop media</Emphasis> command.  If
a job is not being printed because the required media are not mounted on any
candidate printer, its queue status (as indicated by <Emphasis remap="bf">ppop list</Emphasis>) will be
``waiting for media''.  A list of the required media will also be displayed.
Media handling is closely related to but not the same as automatic bin
selection which is described in section <XRef LinkEnd="automatic-bin-selection">.
</Para>

</Sect1>

<Sect1>
<Title>Automatic Modification of Print Jobs</Title>

<Para>
The PPR spooler has the ability to modify the print job by inserting PostScript
code to turn on special printer features such as duplex printing, or to select the
bin which contains the required paper.  Features or this sort are described in
this section.
</Para>

<Sect2>
<Title>Inclusion of Feature Code</Title>

<Para>
When <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> is invoked, the user may specify the names of printer features
which should be invoked.  These features are specified with the <Emphasis remap="bf">-F</Emphasis> switch.
The names are those used in the printer's PPD file.  These are the same names as
appear in the PPD file.  Here is an example:  to print a file called
``<Literal remap="tt">mydoc.test</Literal>'' on the printer ``myprn'' with duplex mode turned on, we would
use this command:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
$ ppr -d myprn -F '*Duplex DuplexNoTumble' mydoc.test
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
The code for the features selected by <Emphasis remap="bf">-F</Emphasis> switches is inserted in the
Document Setup Section of DSC conforming documents.  For documents which do
not conform, the code is inserted at the begining of the document.  The code
to insert is taken directly from the printer's PPD file.
</Para>

<Para>
When inserted, the code is enclosed in
``<Literal remap="tt">&percnt;&percnt;Begin(End)Feature:</Literal>'' comments.  When the spooler inserts
duplex code, it brackets the duplex code with code to save and restore the
current transform matrix since for at least some printers, the duplex code
given in the PPD file seems to execute "initmatrix".  The two extra lines of
bracketing code generated by the spooler end with the comment
``<Literal remap="tt">&percnt;PPR</Literal>''.  When the spooler inserts code requested with the <Emphasis remap="bf">-F</Emphasis>
switch in a DSC conformant document, it inserts it at the top of the document
setup section, right after the automatic bin selection code described in the
next section, unless it is duplex code.  Duplex code is inserted at the very
end of the document-setup section.  This is done to give it a better chance of
overriding duplex setting code already in the document.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2 id="automatic-bin-selection">
<Title>Automatic Bin Selection</Title>

<Para>
Automatic bin selection is a feature which is closely related to media
handling (see section <XRef LinkEnd="media-handling">), but it
is not the same since it may be disabled for any given job even if media
handling is being used.  Automatic bin selection will only work if media
handling is also used, that is, if the bin list for the printer is not empty.
</Para>

<Para>
If a print job requires only one type of medium and automatic bin selection
is in effect, then the spooler will insert code in the job to select the
paper tray which contains the required medium. (Does automatic bin selection
work for jobs with multiple media types?  Maybe, but it has not been well
tested.)
</Para>

<Para>
Since many documents already contains code which influences input tray selection,
automatic tray selection is not always successful.  This is the strategy used:  In
the case of non-conforming documents, the code is inserted at the begining of the
document.  This code will be overridden by any bin select code in the document.
In the case of conforming documents, that is, those with a properly commented
document setup section, the bin select code is inserted at the beginning of the
document setup section.  The likelihood of this code's suceeding depends on
whether the bin select code the document already contains is properly commented.
For example, it works better with Apple's LaserWriter 8 than with earlier versions
of the LaserWriter driver.  LaserWriter 8 encloses the code which selects paper
source and size in standard comments.  These comments allow the spooler to modify
this code.  This is how PPR modifies the code: It removes any <Emphasis remap="sf">*InputSlot</Emphasis> code
and changes <Emphasis remap="sf">*PageSize</Emphasis> code to equivelent <Emphasis remap="sf">*PageRegion</Emphasis> code.  The spooler
removes code by placing a percent sign and a space in front of each line,
converting the code into comments.  It also changes the DSC comments it replaces
into ordinary comments by placing a percent sign and space in front of each line.
Thus, you can examine the spooler output and see what code it has replaced. (You
can examine the spooler output by setting up a printer with the interface
<Emphasis remap="bf">dummy</Emphasis>. If you wish to know what code is being sent to a real printer, set up
the dummy printer with the same options, including PPD file, bins, and mounted
media.)
</Para>

<Para>
Combined with the automatic bin selection feature is the automatic autoswitch
selection feature.  If the bin selected is named ``Upper'' or ``Lower'', and there
is another bin named ``Lower'' or ``Upper'', the autoswitch selection feature
comes into play.  If the bin with the opposite name has the same medium mounted,
then the automatic tray switch feature is turned on using the code from the PPD
file.  If the opposite bin has a different type of medium mounted, then the
automatic tray switch feature is turned off using the code from the PPD file.  (The
HP 4 series of printers do not seem to have a command to turn off the automatic
tray switch feature. This should be regarded as a defect.)
</Para>

<Para>
The automatic bin selection feature may be disabled by deleting all of the defined
bins with the <Emphasis remap="bf">ppad bins delete</Emphasis> command.  It may be suppressed for the current
job with <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis>'s <Emphasis remap="bf">-B false</Emphasis> switch.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Multiple Copies</Title>

<Para>
The spooler can insert code to change the number of copies of a document
which are printed.  You may ask to have this code inserted by using the <Emphasis remap="bf">-n</Emphasis>
switch when invoking <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis>.
</Para>

<Para>
If the document is DSC conforming, the code to
select the number of copies is inserted at the end of the Document Setup
Section.  If the document sets the number of copies, the code inserted by
the spooler, coming later in the document, will override it.  Of course, if
a job sets the number of copies after the end of the Document Setup
Section, this technique will not work.  (A document which defines the number
of copies outside the Document Setup Section breaks the rules of DSC
conformance.)
</Para>

<Para>
If a document does not have the DSC comments necessary to identify the Document
Setup Section, the code is inserted at the top of the document.  This code takes a
different form from that inserted in a Document Setup Section:  the code redefines
<Emphasis remap="sf">showpage</Emphasis> as a procedure which sets the number of copies before executing the
real showpage.
</Para>

<Para>
If you invoke ppr with the <Emphasis remap="bf">-n collate</Emphasis> switch, then PPR will print collated
copies.  It will do this by either sending the whole document multiple times,
for non DSC conforming documents, or by sending only the pages multiple times,
for DSC conforming documents.  The number of copies desired as well as collated
copies may also be requested by means of a <Emphasis remap="sf">&percnt;&percnt;Requirements:</Emphasis>
comment in the document header if the <Emphasis remap="bf">-R copies</Emphasis> switch was used when
invoking <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis>.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>N-Up Printing</Title>

<Para>
PPR can insert code to cause several virtual pages to be printed on one physical
page, possibly reducing the size of the pages in order to do so. This feature may
be invoked with the <Emphasis remap="bf">-N</Emphasis> <Emphasis remap="it">n</Emphasis> switch where <Emphasis remap="it">n</Emphasis> indicates the number of
virtual pages to be put on each side of the physical page.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Signature Printing</Title>

<Para>
A signature is a booklet-like unit of a book which is sewn or glued together with
other signatures to make a book complete.  A signature is printed in such a way
that the sheets of paper on which it is printed may be stacked and folded in the center.  When they are thus
folded and glued, stapled, or sewn at the fold, the pages will be in the correct
order.  PPR can print a DSC conforming document as one or more signatures.  2-Up
mode is used to accomplish this. The pages are re-ordered before they are sent to
the printer.  It is necessary to send the pages to the printer out of sequence so
that when the signatures are folded the pages will be in the correct order.
Signiture printing is invoked with the <Emphasis remap="bf">-s</Emphasis> switch.  This switch takes an
argument which is the number of sheets of paper which should be used to make each
signature.  This switch also turns on 2-Up mode and duplex mode. The number of
pages which will fit in a signature is the number of sheets multiplied by 4.
</Para>

<Para>
Signiture printing works best with a duplex printer, however it is possible to
print signatures without a duplex-capable printer.  The <Emphasis remap="bf">-s fronts</Emphasis> and <Emphasis remap="bf">-s
backs</Emphasis> switches make this possible.  It will be necessary to submit the job once,
with the <Emphasis remap="bf">-s fronts</Emphasis> switch (in addition to the <Emphasis remap="bf">-s</Emphasis> switch which specifies
the number of sheets); take the paper from the output tray, turn it around, and
put it back in the input tray, and submit the job again with the <Emphasis remap="bf">-s backs</Emphasis>
switch.  This works, but it is tricky since you must first make sure no one else
is using the printer, and figuring out which way to insert the paper the second
time is not easy.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Booklet Printing</Title>

<Para>
Booklet printing is just like signature printing, except PPR automatically
selects the minimum number of signature sheets needed to print the entire document
in one booklet.  Booklet mode is invoked with the <Emphasis remap="bf">-s booklet</Emphasis> switch.  As with
signature mode, booklets can be printed on a simplex printer by passing the paper
through twice the first time with the <Emphasis remap="bf">-s fronts</Emphasis> switch and the second time
with the <Emphasis remap="bf">-s backs</Emphasis> switch.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Page Reversal</Title>

<Para>
PPR can often re-order the pages of a document so that they will stack in the
proper order in a printer's face-up output tray.  In the case of duplex and N-Up
printing, PPR will work back and forth through the document and will generate
blank pages where necessary in order to achieve correctly stacked output.  The
desired output order for a printer may be specified with the <Emphasis remap="bf">ppad outputorder</Emphasis>
command.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Automatic Resource Downloading</Title>

<Para>
Whenever PPR prints a job which contains <Emphasis remap="sf">&percnt;&percnt;Include:</Emphasis>
comments it attempts to insert the resources requested.  There are three
sources of resources available to PPR.
</Para>

<Para>
One source is the resource library in
the directory <Literal remap="tt">/usr/ppr/cache</Literal>.  These several procedure sets used
by PPR, a few vendor's procedure sets which are included because there are
broken versions out there which we don't want corrupting the cache, and a
few patched vendor procedure sets.
</Para>

<Para>
The second source is the font index.
&lsqb;This section has not been written yet.]
</Para>

<Para>
The third source is the resource cache in <Literal remap="tt">/var/spool/ppr/cache</Literal>.
Whenever PPR processes a job with an resource it does not have in the cache, it
adds a copy of it to the cache.  The purpose of this is to reduce resource
download time in the future.  LaserWriter 8 will generally refrain from
downloading a font if the PPR Macintosh printer server <Emphasis remap="bf">papsrv</Emphasis> informs it that
the font is already in the printer.  (Of course, it is in the printer, it is in
the cache, but from the viewpoint of the Macintosh client it is the same thing.)
Also, some PostScript drivers for Microsoft Windows allow the downloading of the
procedure set to be turned off.  As long as one job has been printed with it
turned on, the procedure set will be in the cache and if downloading is
subsequently turned off, the MS-Windows driver will include a comment in each
document telling where to re-insert the procedure set from the cache.

<Title>Font Substitution</Title>

<Para>
Sometimes a font manufacturer changes the name of a font.  For example,
MonoType's font ``MBembo'' became ``Bembo''.  At other times, fonts within the same
family will differ only in width.  In that case, a reasonable substitute may be
achieved by adjusting the width of the substitute font.
</Para>

If the required fonts are called out with DSC comments, then PPR can
automatically substitutes fonts.  The file <Literal remap="tt">fontsub.conf</Literal> is consulted

<Sect1 id="interfaces1">
<Title>Printer Interface Programs</Title>

<Para>
The <Emphasis remap="bf">pprdrv</Emphasis> communicates with the printer through an interface program.
An interface program must read the PostScript code from stdin and send it to
the printer.  If the interface receives messages from the printer it must copy
them to stdout.
</Para>

<Para>
An interface may also have a r&ocirc;le in indicating to the printer were
one PostScript job begins and another ends.  For example, if a flag page is
printed before the job it is necessary that the PostScript interpreter be reset
after processing the code for the banner page and before processing the
code for the job proper.  Otherwise, commands executed to print the banner page
could have lingering effects which would prevent the job printing correctly.
With flag pages printed after the job, the problem is even more severe. If an
error occurs in the job, the PostScript interpreter will throw away the rest of
the job, and since it has know way of knowing when the job ends and the banner
page begins it will throw away the flag page too.  Even if the job prints
correctly, if it leaves the device space transformed or standard commands
redefined, the flag page may not print correctly.
</Para>

<Para>
The method used to indicate job boundaries to the printer is known as the
job break method.  The job break method for a printer may be set with the
<Emphasis remap="bf">ppad jobbreak</Emphasis> command.  There are four basic catagories of job break
methodes:
</Para>

<Para>
There are two unsatisfactory jobbreak methods provided for testing
purposes.  One is a job break method <Emphasis remap="bf">none</Emphasis>.  As its name implies, it does
not attempt to indicate job boundaries.  It will seldom if ever prove
satisfactory.  On a serial connexion, for example, the printer will be unable
to distinguish sucessive jobs.  With some interfaces it may work because the
very act of starting the interface indicates the start of a new job.  This may
be true of interfaces which invoke Ghostscript or interfaces which make network
connexions using certain protocols such as AppleTalk. However even in these
cases, the job break method <Emphasis remap="bf">none</Emphasis> will cause problems if banner or trailer
pages are printed or if PPR elects to print multiple copies of the job by
sending the whole job multiple times.
</Para>

<Para>
The other unsatisfactory method is called <Emphasis remap="bf">save/restore</Emphasis>.  This is
only a slight improvement on <Emphasis remap="bf">none</Emphasis>.  When using the <Emphasis remap="bf">save/restore</Emphasis>
job break method <Emphasis remap="bf">pprdrv</Emphasis> brackets each job with the PostScript commands
<Emphasis remap="sf">save</Emphasis> and <Emphasis remap="sf">restore</Emphasis>.
</Para>

<Para>
The job break methods in the second catagory employ the control character
control-D (character code 4) to separate jobs.  If the method is
<Emphasis remap="bf">control-d</Emphasis>, <Emphasis remap="bf">pprdrv</Emphasis> sends a control-D to terminate any old job which
may be lingering in the printer and then sends the jobs one at a time, ending
each job with a control-D.
</Para>

<Para>
When a PostScript printer receives a control-D over a serial interface or,
in the case of HP printers with JetDirect cards, over a TCP/IP interface, it
finishes processing the job and then responds with a control-D.  Thus when all
the jobs have been completed, the number of control D's received should equal
the number sent.  A good printer interface program will count the number of
control-D's it copies to the printer and will keep the connexion open until it
receives an equal number.  Only by so doing can it know that the jobs have been
completely processed and that it has received all of the messages (such as
PostScript error notifications) that are coming.  If the communictions channel
is in fact one-way it will never receive any control-D's and will wait forever.
For this reason it is necessary to set the queue up corectly with the <Emphasis remap="bf">ppad
feedback</Emphasis> command.  See the ppad(8) man page for further information on this
topic.
</Para>

<Para>
The job break method <Emphasis remap="bf">pjl</Emphasis> is the same as <Emphasis remap="bf">control-d</Emphasis> except that it adds HP
PJL commands to display the user name on the printer's message panel and to turn
on reporting of page completion (see sections <XRef LinkEnd="user-name-display"> and <XRef LinkEnd="progress-reporting">).
</Para>

<Para>
Two more job break methods depend on the interface to indicate job breaks to
the printer.  These are <Emphasis remap="bf">signal</Emphasis> and <Emphasis remap="bf">signal/pjl</Emphasis>.  Whenever a job
break is required, <Emphasis remap="bf">pprdrv</Emphasis> finishes sending the current job to the
interface and then sends the interace SIGUSR1.  When the interface receives
SIGUSR1, it reads all it can from <Emphasis remap="bf">pprdrv</Emphasis>, sends it to the printer and then
indicates the job break to the printer.  When the printer has acknowledged the
job break, the interface will send SIGUSR1 to <Emphasis remap="bf">pprdrv</Emphasis>.  This method is
implemented by the interface <Emphasis remap="bf">atalk</Emphasis> which indicates the division between
jobs to the printer by means of a special feature of the AppleTalk Printer
Access Protocol.
</Para>

<Para>
The final job break method is <Emphasis remap="bf">newinterface</Emphasis>.  When using this method,
<Emphasis remap="bf">pprdrv</Emphasis> runs the interface repeately, once for each actual print job or
flag page.  This is useful when the very act of shutting down the interface and
starting it up again resets the PostScript interpreter.  This is true for
interfaces which invoke Ghostscript, such as <Emphasis remap="bf">gssimple</Emphasis>, <Emphasis remap="bf">gstcpip</Emphasis>, and
<Emphasis remap="bf">gsatalk</Emphasis>.  This would also work for the <Emphasis remap="bf">atalk</Emphasis> interface, but the job
break methods <Emphasis remap="bf">signal</Emphasis> and <Emphasis remap="bf">signal/pjl</Emphasis> are more efficient.
</Para>

<Para>
Detailed technical specifications for a printer interface can be found in
Appendix <XRef LinkEnd="interfaces2">.
</Para>

</Sect1>

<Sect1>
<Title>Printer Fault Handling</Title>

<Para>
This topic has already been touched on in section <XRef LinkEnd="printer-errors">.  It is the responsibility of the interface program to
connect to the printer, accept the data and send it to the printer.  If it cannot
accomplish its job it will exit with a code which indicates the reason for the
failure.  It will generally also append a diagnostic message to the printer's
alert log.
</Para>

<Para>
One of these codes is EXIT&lowbar;PRNERR.  This code indicates that an error has
occured which prevents effective communication with the printer, but the error
is of a sort that may clear up.  The first time such an error occurs, <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis>
will wait for 10 seconds and then try printing again.  After each failure the
delay time is increased by 10 seconds until it reaches 10 minutes after which
point it does not continue to increase.  Errors of this sort may result in
alert message being sent to an operator.
</Para>

<Para>
Another code is EXIT&lowbar;PRNERR&lowbar;NORETRY.  This code is similiar to the one
above, but it is used for conditions which are unlikely to be self correcting.
An invalid printer address or interface option is an example of such an error.
These errors too may result in an alert message being sent to an operator.
</Para>

<Para>
A third code is EXIT&lowbar;SIGNAL.  An interface should terminate with this code
if it catches the TERM signal.  When a printer is halted or a printing job is
canceled, <Emphasis remap="bf">pprdrv</Emphasis> sends SIGTERM in order to kill the interface.  An
interface is not required to have a handler for this signal since the default
action is to die, but if the interface has any special shutdown action it must
take, it should catch this signal and then exit with the code EXIT&lowbar;SIGNAL.
</Para>

<Para>
A fourth code is EXIT&lowbar;ENGAGED.  An interface should exit with this code if
has good reason to believe that the printer is present and turned on but is
busy printing a job from another computer or is off-line.  When an interface
exits with this code, <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis> delays for 60 seconds and then tries again.  No
alert notice will be sent to the operator.

<Title>Commentators</Title>

<Para>
A commentator is a file or external program which is fed information which
allows it to keep up a running commentary on the activities of PPR as they
relate to a certain printer.
</Para>

<Para>
A commentator may be activated full-time for a certain printer.  In this case,
it will send messages whenever a selected event occurs on a specific printer
queue regardless of whose job is being printed.
</Para>

<Para>
In contrast, a user can ask for commentary at the time he submits a job.  The
commentary messages will only be sent while that job is printing and no matter
which printer it is printed on.
</Para>

<Sect2>
<Title>Activating a Full-Time Commentator</Title>

<Para>
A full-time commentator may be activated by editing a printer's configuration

</Para>

<Para>
In the first example, whenever something interesting happens (what is
interesting is defined by the number 5) the program
<Emphasis remap="bf">/usr/ppr/commentators/audio</Emphasis> is invoked.  In the second example, the
number which descibes what the commentator wants to hear about is different.
The commentator program is also different:  <Literal remap="tt">/usr/ppr/commentators/samba</Literal>
will be invoked.  You may put as many <Emphasis remap="sf">Commentator:</Emphasis> lines in a printer
configuration file as you wish.
</Para>

<Para>
In these examples, the first parameter, (5 and 15 in the examples) is a
bitmask which defines what we find interesting.  You should determine
this value by adding together the values which stand for the types of
events you are interested in.  The value 5 is formed by adding 1, for
printer errors, and 4 for printer stalls.

8) PPR's assessment of the serverity of the situation.  This

<Para>
In this example, the first raw data field contains a message received from the
printer.  The normal message field contains a standard version of this
message.  (Believe it or not, printers don't all phrase these messages the
same.)  The various forms are converted to standardized forms using the
information in the file <Literal remap="tt">/etc/ppr/lw&lowbar;messages.conf</Literal>.

<Para>
Notice that in this last example the field which ought to contain the message
for the user is blank.  However, first raw data field contains the message
exactly as it was received from the printer.  Apperenly, PPR did find a
standard form of this message in its data files.
</Para>

<Para>
Also notice that in the last two examples the second raw data field is blank.
The second raw data field is currently blank for this type of message but in a
future version of PPR will contain the translated version of this message from
the printer's PPD file.  The language will be indicated by the first word of
the message.
</Para>

<Para>
If the program name in the printer configuration file is ``file'', the event is
appended to the file which is named in the address field.  When the file is
opened, the PPR home directory, (usually /usr/ppr) is the current directory.
You can rely on this or you can begin your file name with a ``/''.  If the
commentator program name is not ``file'' and does not begin with a ``/'', it is
understood to be a program in the <Literal remap="tt">/usr/ppr/commentators</Literal> directory.  If
you want to use a program in another directory, you must begin its name with a
``/''.  Commentators should exit as soon as possible because <Emphasis remap="bf">pprdrv</Emphasis> will
wait for up to 60 seconds for all the commentators it has launced to exit.  If
necessary, commentators should place their work in the background or in a queue
and then exit.

<Title>The Audio Commentator</Title>

<Para>
This is the most elaborate commentator by far.  It makes spoken
announcements concerning the printer's condition.  To use the audio commentator
you must have Perl 5.  You must also install the sound files.  To install the
sound files, get <Literal remap="tt">ppr-speach-1.30.tar.gz</Literal> and unpack it in the PPR home
directory (which is usually <Literal remap="tt">/usr/ppr</Literal>).  To set up the audio
commentator you need a commentator line like this one:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
Commentator: 13 audio /dev/xxx level=8
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
Or like this one:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
Commentator: 13 audio smith.pc.myorg.org:15009 level=10
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
Both these lines This will cause events of certain types (indicated by the
bitmask 13 or 31) to be reported using the audio commentator.  The commentator
is also passed the option <Emphasis remap="sf">level=10</Emphasis> which it uses to furthur filter the
events which have been selected by the bitmask.  A level of 10 will result in
the reporting of all events, even the sucessful printing of a job.  Lower
numbers will exclude mundane events.  Remember, the bitmask is formed by
summing the desired catagories of messages.  The catagories are:

</VariableList>

<Para>
The address indicates the means of playing the sound file.  The current version
of the audio commentator provides two ways to do this.  If the address begins
with ``/'', as in the first example, then the sound is played on the local
machine.  The code to accomplish this is in the file
<Literal remap="tt">/usr/ppr/lib/play&lowbar;local.pl</Literal>.  This code is presently very redimentry
and requires a program which will take the name of the file to be played as its
argument.  As distributed, the program <Emphasis remap="bf">/usr/local/bin/play</Emphasis> is used and
the address is ignored.  Because the address is ignored, the silly address
``/dev/xxx'' is used in the example above.  Any help with improving this would
be greatly appreciated.
</Para>

<Para>
In the second example, the audio commentator is passed the address
``smith.pc.myorg.org:15009''.  This indicates that the sound is to be played on
the machine ``smith.pc.myorg.org'' and the program which will play the sound is
listening for requests on TCP/IP port number 15009.  Playing the sound on a
remote
machine requires Samba and a MS-Windows 95 computer equiped with <Emphasis remap="bf">Tcl/Tk</Emphasis>
and the script <Emphasis remap="bf">pprpopup.tcl</Emphasis> which may be found in the <Literal remap="tt">misc</Literal> directory
of
the PPR source code.  When the audio commentator wants the MS-Windows 95
computer
to play a sound file it places the file in a directory which is shared through
Samba.  The audio commentator then opens a TCP/IP connexion to the remote
computer.  The script <Emphasis remap="bf">pprpopup.tcl</Emphasis> will be listening on that port and will
receive a request to play the audio file whose location is specified by a UNC
path
such as
``&bsol;&bsol;mjagger.serve&bsol;pprclipr&bsol;smith-pc-myorg-org-15009-3001''.
The <Emphasis remap="bf">pprpopup.tcl</Emphasis> script will launch a program to play the file and report
back when it is done.  The audio commentator will then remove the temporary file
and exit.  In order for this to work, you must edit your <Literal remap="tt">smb.conf</Literal> file and
add a section to share PPR's client spooling directory.  Add the following
lines:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
[pprclipr]
  comment = PPR client spooling directory
  path = /var/spool/ppr/pprclipr
  printable = no
  writable = no
  public = yes
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
You must also obtain <Emphasis remap="bf">Tcl/Tk</Emphasis> for MS-Windows
(<Literal remap="tt">ftp://ppr-dist.trincoll.edu/pub/ppr/win41p1.exe</Literal>) an install it.  The
script <Emphasis remap="bf">pprpopup.tcl</Emphasis> should be copied from the PPR source directory
<Literal remap="tt">misc</Literal> to your MS-Windows machine.  You should then run the script.  The
script <Emphasis remap="bf">pprpopup.tcl</Emphasis> uses the Netscape audio player to play the file.  This
player is used because many people already have it installed and because the
version for MS-Windows 95 can handle UNC paths with long filename components.
The script can be easily modified to work with other audio players.  Information
about other programs which can be used for this purpose would be greatly
appreciated.  Whatever method of playing the sound you select, the easiest way
to test the commentator is to set the bitmask to 31, the options to ``level=10''
and print a job. You should hear something like, ``The printer emm cee ee cee
underscore one has just printed a document.''
</Para>

</Sect1>

<Sect1>
<Title>Input Filters</Title>

<Para>
One of the most noteworthy features of PPR is its ability to determine the
type of the input file and automatically convert it to PostScript if
necessary.  The type of the input file is determined by two methods.  The first
method is the most reliable.  The second is employed only if the first fails.
</Para>

<Para>
The first method is to look for a ``magic number'' at the start of the
file.  Many file format specifications dictate that files conforming to them
always begin with certain signature bytes.  Formats which specify a signature
or magic number include DSC conforming PostScript, JFIF, GIF, PNG, DVI,
WordPerfect documents, PBM, XPM and others.
</Para>

<Para>
If no recognized magic number is found, then the first 8192 bytes of the
file are scanned and the number of times certain characters and constructs are
found are counted.  The things counted include ASCII control characters,
non-ASCII characters, HP escape sequences, Troff-style dot commands, TeX style
backslash commands, and PostScript procedure definitions.  When these things
have been counted, the totals are used to try to guess at the file format.
</Para>

<Para>
If PPR ever fails to determine a file's format correctly or you wish to
print a file in a format for which auto-detection is not available, you can
override the auto-detection mechanism with <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis>'s <Emphasis remap="bf">-T</Emphasis> switch
<FOOTNOTE>

<Para>
See the
ppr(1) man page for details.
</Para>

</FOOTNOTE>
.
</Para>

<Para>
Once the file format has been determined, unless it is PostScript, it is
necessary to pass the file through a filter.  A PPR filter is a program which
reads the file from its standard input and writes PostScript on its standard
output.  It is the PostScript code emmited by the filter that PPR sends to the
printer.
</Para>

<Para>
A number of filters are supplied with PPR.  PPR also includes a number of
shell and Perl scripts which work together with programs such as TeX, Troff,
PBMPlus, and other programs often found on Unix systems to form filters.  If
the supporting programs can not be found, the script filters will not be
installed.
</Para>

<Para>
PPR can automatically recognize a number of file types for which it does not
have filters.  PPR determines whether it has a filter for a file of a certain
type by looking in the <Literal remap="tt">/usr/ppr/filters</Literal> directory for a file with a name
in the form <Literal remap="tt">filter&lowbar;</Literal><Emphasis remap="it">type</Emphasis>.  For instance, if the input file is of type
<Emphasis remap="bf">fortran</Emphasis>, it will look for <Literal remap="tt">/usr/ppr/filters/filter&lowbar;fortran</Literal>.  You may
write your own filters and install them in the <Literal remap="tt">/usr/ppr/lib</Literal>
directory.  For explicit information on writing filters, see Appendix <XRef LinkEnd="filters">.
</Para>

<Para>
Each filter recieves a list of filter options.  This option list is created by
concatenating the default filter options with all of the filter options specified
with <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis>'s <Emphasis remap="bf">-o</Emphasis> switch.  Before invoking the filter, <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> culls the
option list.  It removes any option which is intended to apply only to a specific
filter other than the one being used.  An option may be applied to a single filter
by prefixing its name with the name of the filter and a hyphen.  For example, the
option ``noisy=yes'' should apply to all filters and hence won't be culled but the
option ``dvi-noisy=yes'' will be deleted by <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> except when it is invoking
the DVI filter.  A filter, such as the <Emphasis remap="bf">tex</Emphasis> filter, may invoke another filter
such as the dvi filter to do part of its work.  The first filter will generally
pass its options on to the second filter, however, since the filter list has
already been culled, the DVI filter will receive options whose names begin with
``tex-'' but will not receive options whose names begin with
``dvi-''

<Title>The <Emphasis remap="bf">pr</Emphasis> Filter</Title>

<Para>
The <Emphasis remap="bf">pr</Emphasis> filter passes the input through the Unix <Emphasis remap="bf">pr</Emphasis> program and then
through the Line Printer Emulator.  It supports the options <Emphasis remap="bf">width=</Emphasis> and
<Emphasis remap="bf">length=</Emphasis> which are passed to <Emphasis remap="bf">pr</Emphasis> as the arguments to its <Emphasis remap="bf">-w</Emphasis> and
<Emphasis remap="bf">-l</Emphasis> switches respectively.  Since the this filter invokes the Line Printer
Emulator, it supports all the options of that filter too.
</Para>

<Para>
This filter will never be invoked automatically since plain text files are
normally processed by the Line Printer Emulator.  In order to employ this
filter you must invoke <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> with the switch <Emphasis remap="bf">-T pr</Emphasis>.

This filter prints files encoded with fortran carriage control.  This filter
supports the options <Emphasis remap="bf">width=</Emphasis> and <Emphasis remap="bf">length=</Emphasis> which specify the page width
in columns and the page length in lines respectively.

<Title>Various Image File Filters</Title>

<Para>
Depending on which image file utilities your system has, filters may be
available for various image file formats.  These filters are shell scripts
which invoke programs such as the PBM utilities and the Independent JPEG
Group's programs.  These filters will be installed and edited to fit your
configuration if the required utilies are in the PATH when you invoke
<Emphasis remap="bf">/usr/ppr/fixup/fixup&lowbar;filters</Emphasis>.  These filters support some options,
but they are generally ones such as <Emphasis remap="bf">resolution=</Emphasis> and <Emphasis remap="bf">color=</Emphasis> which
PPR supplies automatically as default filter options.

<Title>The Hex Dump Filter</Title>

<Para>
This filter prints side-by-side hexadecimal and ASCII dump of the first few
hundred bytes of the input file (as much as will fit on one page).  This filter
will sometimes be used to print input files for which no filter is available.
This filter will only be used if either the <Emphasis remap="bf">-e hexdump</Emphasis> switch was used
when invoking <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> or if it was not possible to inform the user of the
problem by means of a message on stderr or by invoking a resonder

<Title>The TeX Source Filter</Title>

<Para>
This filter is written in Perl, so it will not be available if Perl was not
installed last time you ran <Literal remap="tt">/usr/ppr/fixup&lowbar;filters</Literal>. This
filter will read the input file and attempt to identify it as either Plain TeX
or LaTeX.  It will then copy the file to a temporary directory and run TeX
on it with either the Plain or LaTeX macros.  It will run TeX multiple
times if it is necessary to get the cross references right.
</Para>

<Para>
If running TeX results in a fatal error, TeX's output is passed through the
Line Printer Emulator and becomes the output of the filter and hence what gets
printed.  On the other hand, if TeX ran successfully, the DVI file is passed to
the DVI filter.
</Para>

<Para>
This filter has one option, <Emphasis remap="bf">noisy=</Emphasis>.  If <Emphasis remap="bf">noisy=</Emphasis> is set to <Emphasis remap="bf">true</Emphasis> then
progress messages and the terminal output of TeX are printed on stderr.  The
<Emphasis remap="bf">noisy=</Emphasis> option is also passed through to the DVI filter.  (This filter passes
all of its options on the the DVI filter, the DVI filter will ignore those it does
not understand.)  Remember, if you intend an option to apply only to this filter
and the instance of the DVI filter which it invokes, you should prefix ``tex-'' to
the option name even if you want the option to be passed through to the DVI
filter.  For example, if you invoke <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> with the option  <Emphasis remap="bf">-o 'noisy=false
tex-noisy=true'</Emphasis> then the DVI filter will be quiet if you submit a DVI file but
will print noisy messages if you submit a LaTeX file to <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis>.

<Title>The Texinfo Filter</Title>

<Para>
This filter did not work (except possibly for the users ``ppr'' and ``root''
in versions 1.00, 1.10, and 1.20 of PPR.  It been fixed for version 1.30.  This
filter is a shell script which converts documents from the Texinfo format used
by the GNU project to PostScript.  It first passes them through texi2dvi (which
you must provide).  It then passes the resulting DVI file through the DVI
filter.
</Para>

<Para>
This filter supports the option <Emphasis remap="bf">noisy=</Emphasis>.  If one uses a command such as:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
$ ppr -d aardvark -o noisy=yes
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
a running commentary will be printed as the file is converted.  This commentary
includes whatever TeX sends to stdout.  The <Emphasis remap="bf">noisy=</Emphasis> option is also passed
on to the DVI filter, so it produces lots of messages too, including the
terminal output of DVIPS.
</Para>

<Title>The DVI Filter</Title>

<Para>
This filter is a shell script which converts TeX DVI files to PostScript. It
uses the program DVIPS to do this.  Unfortunately DVIPS was not designed to use
PPD files, rather it uses a printer configuration file format of its own.  The
PPR DVI filter generates these configuration files automatically.  Once
generated, a DVIPS configuration file is stored in
<Literal remap="tt">/var/spool/ppr/dvips</Literal>.  The file's name contains the MetaFont mode, the
resolution, and the amount of free memory in the printer.  These values will
also appear in the appropriate places in the configuration file.  The DVI
filter obtains these values from its options.  The options <Emphasis remap="bf">resolution=</Emphasis>,
<Emphasis remap="bf">freevm=</Emphasis>, and <Emphasis remap="bf">mfmode=</Emphasis> are among the automatically supplied to augment
any the user specifies by invoking <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> with the <Emphasis remap="bf">-o</Emphasis> switch.  The
automatically generated options are regenerated every time a printer's PPD file
is changed.  The options are stored in the <Emphasis remap="sf">DefFiltOpts:</Emphasis> line in the printer's
or group's configuration file.
