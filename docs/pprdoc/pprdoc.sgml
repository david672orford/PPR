<abstract>

<para>This document is intended to describe <application>PPR</application>'s features and theory of
operation more deaply than <citetitle>Installing and Using PPR</citetitle>
does.  Unfortunately, this document has never been finished.</para>

</abstract>

<sect1>
<title>Introduction to <application>PPR</application></title>

<para><application>PPR</application> is designed to operate printers which
use page description languages compatible with the PostScript language
defined by Adobe Systems. It is true that a PostScript printer can generally
be made to work with an ordinary print spooler.  Enhancements, generally in
the form of special filters or interface programs, are available for both
the <application>System V LP</application> spooler and the
<application>Berkeley LPR</application> spooler.  However, these are
generally rather limited adaptations written to fulfill a pressing need,
such as the need to print banner pages. In order to fully exploit the more
sophisticated features of PostScript and the Adobe Document Structuring
Convention, it seemed best to start from scratch, writing a print spooler
designed with modern PostScript laser printers in mind.</para>

<para>It is one of the goals of this project to produce a print spooler
which can accept print jobs from many different types of computer systems
simultaneously.  This includes logged-in Unix users, MS-DOS and MS-Windows
users, Unix users on remote systems through the LPR/LPD protocol, and Apple
Macintosh computers.</para>

<para>The spooler is designed to provide services such as font and resource
caching which should reduce the time a Macintosh computer requires to
generate and transmit the print file.</para>

<para>On MS-DOS systems, many application programs are not able to generate
PostScript themselves.  For this reason, <application>PPR</application> has an automatic conversion
system which attempts to determine the format of an incoming document and
convert it to PostScript, if necessary.  Filters to convert simple line
printer files or files for popular dot matrix printers are included with
<application>PPR</application>.</para>

<para>
<application>PPR</application> will read Adobe PostScript Printer Description (PPD) files in order to
obtain information about the printers under its control.  <application>PPR</application> will replace
specially marked code fragments in the document with the code fragments from
the PPD file.  Apple's LaserWriter 8 driver properly marks the relevent code
fragments.  If one uses Apple's LaserWriter driver version 8 or later it is
possible for a document to print correctly even if it is printed on a different
printer from that originally intended and the job uses special commands such as
those for bin selection.  It is also possible for an application to request
that <application>PPR</application> insert code fragments from the PPD file in order to invoke specific
features of the printer, such as duplexing or legal size paper.
</para>

<para><application>PPR</application> provides a mechanism whereby the operator specifies the size and
type of paper in each of a printer's bins.  When printing, users will
request the desired paper.  Print jobs will be held back until the operator
changes the paper and indicates to the spooler that he has done so.  If a
job is being held back for this reason, the names of the types of media
required will be indicated in the queue listing.  When the document is
printed, <application>PPR</application> will insert code to select the input tray which holds the
desired medium.</para>

<para>
Where the printer and its interface support it, <application>PPR</application> will capture PostScript
error messages resulting from the execution of a job and put them in a log
file which may be printed on the banner or trailer page or later viewed by the
user.  If a PostScript error occurs during the printing of a job, that job is
held in the queue so that it may be examined to determine the reason for the
failure.
</para>

<para>
<application>PPR</application> can detect printer malfunctions and deal `intelligently' with
them.  If problems persist, it will inform an operator.
</para>

<para>
It is desireable that <application>PPR</application> be able to reliably identify the users on
various computer systems, employing passwords when necessary, so that users
can be made to pay for their use of the printers.  Unfortunately, the necessary
client-side software is not always available.
</para>

<para>
<application>PPR</application> can maintain a list of user accounts, each of which contains money. When
<application>PPR</application> prints a job for a user on a printer which has a per page charge, <application>PPR</application>
computes the number of sheets of paper used and deducts the corresponding
amount of money from the user's account. The system administrator may set a
credit limit for each user. When the credit limit is exceeded, <application>PPR</application> will refuse
to accept more jobs for the user.
</para>

<para>
<application>PPR</application> can convert a document for N-Up printing, thereby saving paper.  It
can also convert many documents to signatures or booklets.
</para>

<title>A Brief Note On Terminology</title>

<para>
This document describes a complete system which accepts print jobs, places
them in a queue, and prints them as soon as it becomes possible. This printing
system is called <application><application>PPR</application></application>.  Unix users
submit jobs to this system by means of a
program called <command>ppr</command>.  Unfortunately, in discussing this system it is
possible to confuse the two.  This document attempts to ease that confusion by
refering to the two in slightly different ways.  When the spooling system as a
whole is meant, it is refered to simply as <application>PPR</application>, in all upper case.  When
the program users employ to submit jobs to <application>PPR</application> is meant, it is refered to as
<command>ppr</command> in all lower case and bold face.  Further, the program for submitting
jobs will frequently be refered to as, "the program <command>ppr</command>."
</para>

<title>Core <application>PPR</application> Components and How They Work Together</title>

<para>
This section describes the subprograms which comprise the core of <application>PPR</application> and
the r&ocirc;le of each.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>How Jobs Enter the Queue</title>

<para>
All jobs which enter the queue pass through the program called
<command>ppr</command>.  This is true even of those which pass first through the
Macintosh print server, the LPR compatible server, or Samba.  (These additional
server components will be described later.)  The program <command>ppr</command> reads a
PostScript file and splits it into 3 files.  These three files are placed in a
spool directory and a fourth file, called the queue file, is created which
describes the job and the options the user has selected.  Once all the files
are ready, <command>ppr</command> sends a message to the print daemon, which is called,
<command>pprd</command>, telling it that a new job is in the queue.  This process is
illustrated in figure <xref linkend="pprdoc-enter"/>.

<sect2>
<title>How Jobs are Printed</title>

<para>When <command>pprd</command> determines that the time has come to print a file on a printer,
it invokes a program called <command>pprdrv</command> which reads the 3 job files and
reasembles them into a PostScript file.  While doing so it will consult
information read from the printer configuration file and the queue file and
a PostScript Printer Description (PPD) file.  It may also include fonts and
other resources in the data stream.  This process is illustrated in figure <xref
linkend="pprdoc-printing2"/>.  (The inclusion of fonts and other resources has been
ommited from the figure for the sake of simplicity.)</para>

</mediaobject>
</figure>

<para>
The program <command>pprdrv</command> sends the file to the printer by invoking an interface
program.  It is the responsibility of the interface program to accept the print
job on standard input, send it the printer, if possible receive any error
messages, and pass them back to <command>pprdrv</command> by writing them to stdout.
</para>

<para>
Notice in figure <xref linkend="pprdoc-printing1"/> that printing is taking place on
<hardware>PRINTER 1</hardware> and <hardware>PRINTER 3</hardware>.
</para>

<para>
<hardware>PRINTER 2</hardware> is idle, so the processes necessary to print on it are shown
with dotted line boxes, indicating that they do not exist at present.
</para>

<para>
Once the job has been printed, the interfaces program exits, after which
<command>pprdrv</command> exits.  The main spooling daemon,
<command>pprd</command> detects this and
removes the job from the queue and attempts to inform the user that the job is
done.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Job Errors</title>

<para>When exiting, <command>pprdrv</command> will indicate to
<command>pprd</command> that printing was successful or that it was not.  If
<command>pprdrv</command> indicates that a problem occured which was caused
by the particular job being printed, a PostScript error for instance, then
the job is placed in the "arrested" state, the user who submitted it is
informed, and <command>pprd</command> looks for another job to print on that
printer.  The arrested state is a special case of the "held" state.  An
arrested job remains in that state until it is canceled or released.</para>

<para>
When a job is arrested, the user who submitted it is informed, however if
the arrested job is subsequently deleted by an operator, the user will not
be informed as he would be if a normal job of his were canceled.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="printer-errors">
<title>Printer Errors</title>

<para>
If <command>pprdrv</command> indicates that the problem is with the printer, then the job
is returned to the queue, the printer is placed in fault mode, and
<command>pprd</command>
looks for another printer on which to print the job.  When
<command>pprdrv</command>
discovers a problem with a printer, it indicates to <command>pprd</command> whether or not it
is a problem from which the printer is likely to recover without the
intervention of the system operator.  Problems from which it is likely to
recover on its own include those which are transient or which an ordinary user
might correct, such as printer-turned-off and out-of-paper.  If the problem is
one from which the printer may recover, then it is placed in fault-retry mode;
if it is not expected to recover, it is placed in fault-no-retry mode.
</para>

<para>
In fault-retry mode, <command>pprd</command> tries to restart the printer at intervals.  The
delay before the retry is 10 seconds the first time and increases by 10 seconds
after each failure until the interval reaches about 10 minutes, at which point
it does not continue to increase.  In fault-no-retry mode, the printer is not
restarted until a system operator restarts it.  An operator may restart a
printer with the command <command>ppop start printer</command>.
</para>

<para>
When <command>pprdrv</command> detects a printer fault, it writes a description of it to a
file in the <filename class="Directory">alerts/</filename> directory, a file which is named after the
printer.  At intervals, <command>pprd</command> may send the contents of this file to a
system operator.  The interval is defined in the printer configuration file.
The interval is expressed as 'every <varname>N</varname> faults.'  If the interval is set
to <literal>1</literal>, the alerts log is sent after each printer fault; if the interval is set
to <literal>5</literal>, the alerts log is sent after every 5th printer fault.  If the interval is
set to <literal>0</literal>, the alerts are never sent.
</para>

<para>
If the alert interval is negative, it is treated differently.  First of all,
the absolute value is used as the alert interval.  Second, the alerts are
only sent to the system operator once.  Third, a notice is sent to the
system operator if the printer successfully prints a job after incurring at
least abs(<varname>N</varname>) alerts.
</para>

<para>
Each time a fault occurs, the alert message is appended to the alert log. The
exception is that if the previous alert occured more than one hour previously,
the alert log is truncated to zero length and a new one started.  Whether or
not the alerts have been dispatched to an operator, the alert log may be read
at any time with the command <command>ppop alerts <replaceable>printer</replaceable></command>.
</para>

<para>
It is in the printer configuration file that the alert interval is specified,
as well as the method by which alerts are to be dispatched and the address to
send them to.  A typical alert dispatch method (indeed, the only one supported
at this time) is <literal>mail</literal>.  This means that the alerts are sent by electronic
mail to the indicated address.  The alert parameters may be set with the
<command>ppad alerts</command> command.
</para>

<title>Printers and Groups of Printers</title>

<para>When printing a document with <application>PPR</application> it is
necessary to specify a set of one more more printer on which it may be
printed.  If you specify the name of a printer,
<application>PPR</application> will print the document on that printer if it
determines that the printer has the necessary capabilities.  If you indicate
a group of printers to print the document on, <application>PPR</application>
will print the document on the first available printer with the necessary
capabilities.  Both printers and groups are identified by name.  A printer
or group name may be up to 16 characters long and may contain any printable
characters except, slash (<literal>/</literal>).  It also must not begin
with tilde (<literal>~</literal>) or period (<literal>.</literal>).</para>

<para>Each printer is described by a printer configuration file in the
directory <filename class="Directory">/etc/ppr/conf/printers/</filename>. 
Each group is defined by a group configuration file in the directory
<filename class="Directory">/etc/ppr/conf/groups</filename>.  The format of
a printer configuration file is described in Appendix <xref
linkend="printer-config"/> and the format of a group configuation file is
described in Appendix <xref linkend="group-config"/>.  The desired printer or
group may be specified with the <option>-d</option> switch to the
<command>ppr</command> command.  If the <option>-d</option> switch is
ommited, <command>ppr</command> takes the printer or group name from the
environment variable <envar>PPRDEST</envar>.  If <envar>PPRDEST</envar> is
not defined, <command>ppr</command> attempts to send the job to a printer or
group called ``default''.</para>

<sect1>
<title>Accepting Jobs From a Network</title>

<para>Users on the machine running <application>PPR</application> can submit
jobs simply by running the program <command>ppr</command>.  But, when the
user is on a remote machine connected by a network to the machine with the
<application>PPR</application> spooler, things get a little more
complicated.</para>

<para>
Accepting network jobs requires a daemon process which waits new connexions.
When it receives a connexion, it must launch a server process.  The server
process will accept the print job and run <command>ppr</command> to submit it.
</para>

<para>Often, the user on the remote computer will not have an account on the
computer that is running <application>PPR</application>.  Therefor, the
server process must run <command>ppr</command> under some system user ID. 
This system ID may be <literal>ppr</literal> or any user listed in
<filename>/etc/ppr/acl/pprprox.allow</filename>. The system user will invoke
<command>ppr</command> with switches such as <option>-f</option>,
<option>-X</option>, and <option>--charge-to</option>. These switches will
indicate that the system user is submitting the job on behalf of a user on a
remote machine.</para>

<para>
The <option>-f</option> switch sets the name of the user who submitted the job.  This name
will appear in queue listings and on banner and trailer pages.
</para>

<para>The <option>-X</option> switch is used to provide a string which
uniquely identifies the user on the remote machine.  Generally, this string
will be the user's name on the remote machine, followed by an
<literal>@</literal>, followed by the network address of the remote
machine.</para>

<para>The <option>--charge-to</option> switch is useful when using the
charge accounts which can be set up with <command>ppuser</command>.  If the
argument of the <option>-f</option> switch is the user's real name, the
<option>--charge-to</option> switch can be used to specify a more cryptic
account name to which the cost of printing printing should be
charged.</para>

<sect2>
<title>Accepting Jobs From Macintoshes</title>

<para>
<application>PPR</application> provides a daemon called <command>papsrv</command> which acts as a Macintosh print
server.  It accepts connexions from Macintosh clients, answers queries using
information in the PPD files, and accepts jobs.  Whenever
<command>papsrv</command> accepts a
connexion from a Macintosh, it forks a copy of itself to service the connexion.
When the child daemon receives a print job, it launches <command>ppr</command> on the end of a
pipe to process it.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Accepting Jobs Using the LPD Protocol</title>

<para>
<application>PPR</application> provides a daemon called <command>lprsrv</command> which can be launched by the internet
super daemon, <command>inetd</command>.  The daemon <command>lprsrv</command> implements the Berkeley LPD protocol.
</para>

<para> When a print job is received, <command>lprsrv</command> checks to see
if the destination specified matches the name of any <application>PPR</application> printer or group.
If it does, <command>ppr</command> is invoked to accept the job.  If not,
the job is fed to the system's default spooler through the
<command>lp</command> or <command>lpr</command> command.  There is a
<command>lprsrv</command> configuration file,
<filename>/etc/ppr/lprsrv.conf</filename>, but it is used for access
control, not for choosing which queues will be shared. All <application>PPR</application> printers as
well as all the printers belonging to the normal system spooler are
automatically made available. </para>

<para>
However, unless <command>inetd</command> invokes <command>lprsrv</command> with the
<option>-p</option> (permissive) switch, it
will only accept jobs from machines listed in
<filename>/etc/hosts.equiv</filename> or
<filename>/etc/hosts.lpd</filename> which are also not listed in
<filename>/etc/hosts.lpd_deny</filename>.  (It is also ok to list a whole domain in these
files.  Any name begining with a period is interpreted as a domain name.)
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Accepting Jobs From a LAN Manager For Unix Server</title>

<para>
AT&amp;T's LAN Manager for Unix can invoke a print processor script when a
job is received for a certain printer.  <application>PPR</application> provides a print processor script
which submits the job using the <command>ppr</command> command.  If the directory
<filename>/var/opt/lanman/customs</filename> exists when <application>PPR</application> is installed, then the script
is installed as <filename>/var/opt/lanman/customs/ppr</filename>.  While it is possible to
prepare several versions of this script to invoke <command>ppr</command> with various
options, it will probably prove more convenient to use the <command>ppad
switchset</command>
or <command>ppad group switchset</command> command (depending on whether it is a printer of a
group) to store the desired switches in the printer or group's configuration
file.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Accepting Jobs From a Samba Server</title>

<para>
The free Unix file and print server Samba has a very flexible printing system.
The print command for any given print queue can be specified in Samba's
configuration file.  The Samba server sends jobs to <application>PPR</application> by writing the job to a
temporary file and then invoking <command>ppr</command>.  The
<option>-U</option> switch should be used to
tell <command>ppr</command> to delete the temporary file once it is done reading it.  It is
advisable to append <literal>&amp;</literal> to the print command because for very large files
which must be filtered, the client will time out before <command>ppr</command> exits.  Sample
Samba print commands are given in <ulink url="../refman/ppr2samba.8.html">the ppr2samba(8) man page</ulink>.
</para>

<title>Identifying Users</title>

<para>
It is often necessary to identify the user who submitted a job.  In the case
of
a printer which is shared by may users, a banner page giving the user's name may
be required.  It is also helpful in queue listings to identify the submitting
user
of each job.  When it is desired to restrict printing privledges or to charge
for
printing, passwords may be in order.
</para>

<para>
Because <application>PPR</application> accepts print jobs from many different kinds of computer systems it
employs several techniques for determining and verifying the identity of users.
Basically, <application>PPR</application> has two user validation modes.  The first is called system
validation mode.  In system validation mode, <application>PPR</application> assumes that since the user
gained access to the system and managed to execute <command>ppr</command> he must be
authorized.  In system validation mode security efforts are concentrated on
preventing the user from disguising his identity to avoid printing charges.  The
other validation mode is authorization code validation mode.  In that mode, an
authorization code (password) is embedded in the job as a PostScript comment or
communicated using a special protocol.  Such a password scheme is advisable when
the jobs are arriving over an unsecured channel, such as an AppleTalk or LAN
Manager network.
</para>

<para>The means by which the user name is determined depends on the
validation mode. In system validation mode, it is the user name of the user
who invoked <command>ppr</command>, unless the user is
<literal>ppr</literal>, <literal>root</literal>, or is listed in
<filename>/etc/ppr/acl/pprprox.allow</filename>.  These are priveledged
users who may accept jobs over the network on behalf of remote users.</para>

<para>When a privledged user is submitting a job on behalf of another, the name may
be supplied with <command>ppr</command>'s <option>-f</option> switch.  A privledged user may also use the
<option>-R for</option> switch to indicate that
<literal>%%For:</literal> lines in the
input file are to be scanned for the user name.  Of course, if the privledged
user employs none of these options then the job will be identified as belonging
to the privledged user who submitted it.
</para>

<para>The name that the priveledged user supplies with the
<option>-f</option> switch will often be a 'real name' such as "Joseph
Andrews".  If printer charge accounts use a shorter name such as
<literal>jandrews</literal> then the <option>--charge-to</option> option
will be used to indicate that name.  In that case, the privledged user might
invoke <command>ppr</command> like this:</para>

<para>

<screen>
$ ppr -d thatprn -f "Joseph Andrews" --charge-to jandrews
</screen>

</para>

<para>
There must also be some mechanism to make sure that a user can't delete another
user's jobs.  For that reason it is necessary to unambiguously identify each
remote user from which a privledged user accepts jobs.  The privledged user
uses the <option>-X</option> switch to inform <command>ppr</command> of this identification.  So, the
command above would become:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
$ ppr -d thatprn -f "Joseph Andrews" --charge-to jandrews -X jandrews@somehost.someorg.org
</screen>

</para>

<para>This will allow <application>PPR</application> to subsequently
distinguish between identically named users on different hosts without
choking up the queue listings and banner pages with a level of detail which
is generally unnecessary.  The <option>-X</option> switch is often referred
to as the "proxy-for switch" for reasons which I hope are obvious.</para>

<para>In authorization code validation mode, the user name is the one
specified in the PostScript <literal>%%For:</literal> line, or if the
<literal>%%For:</literal> line is absent, it is the name specified with the
<option>-f</option> switch.  If both are absent, it is the name of the user
who invoked <command>ppr</command>.  In authorization code validation mode,
the document must contain a PostScript comment with the correct
authorization code.  If it does not, the job will be canceled and the user
will be informed.</para>

<para>
The use name and authorization code may be specified like this:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
%%For: smith
%TCHCTAuthCode: abr9yg
</screen>

</para>

<para>
Authorization code validation mode is selected with <command>ppr</command>'s
<option>-a</option> switch.
</para>

<title>Banner and Trailer Pages</title>

<para>
When many people will be using a printer it is sometimes desirable to
identify each print job with an extra page on which appears the name of the
person who sent it as well as other information such as the name of the
application which generated it and a job title.  <application>PPR</application> is capable of printing
banner pages as well as trailer pages.
</para>

<para>
When a user submits a print job he may request or reject a banner page and
request or reject a trailer page.  However <application>PPR</application> considers the user's request as
a suggestion only, making its final descision based on the user's suggestion,
and the configuration of the printer.
</para>

<para>
If bins are defined for the printer, the suitability of the printer's mounted
forms for printing banner pages is also a factor.  When printing a banner page,
<application>PPR</application> will use the currently mounted medium with the highest suitability rating.
If all mounted media have a suitability rating of 1, no banner or trailer pages
can be printed.  If bins are defined for the printer and media is mounted, <application>PPR</application>
will adjust the size, shape, and character size of the banner page to suit the
medium (paper type) being used.
</para>

<para>
If no bins are defined, the banner page will be formated for 8.5 by 11 inch paper
(or whatever "default medium =" is set to in the [internationalization] section
if <filename>/etc/ppr/ppr.conf</filename>), but no attempt will be made to
select a specific input tray or to request a specific page size of the printer.

<title>Printer Use Logging</title>

<para>
<application>PPR</application> can keep a running log of jobs printed.  To enable this logging, create
an empty file <filename>/var/spool/ppr/logs/printlog</filename>.  One line will be appended
to this file for each job which is successfully printed.
</para>

<para>
Note:  prior to version 1.30, the printlog file format was different.  Two
digits, representing the seconds were added to the time stamp (in the first
field). Also, fields 5, 6, 7, and 9 were inserted between existing fields and
field 11 was added at the end.  The contents of the old fields did not change,
only the positions of some of them did.  Therefore, existing software will
have to be modified to use the new field numbering.
</para>

<para>
<application>PPR</application> releases since 1.30 have added new fields, so some of the fields at the end
may not be present in log files created by old versions of <application>PPR</application>.  You should keep
this in mind when writing software that parses this log file.

19961115131401,rotate-1375.0(mouse),chipmunk,"David Chappell",chappell,
	"",7,1,2,166,30.12,0.00,-1,80123,2
</screen>

(In reality this would be a single long line.  We have split the example line
so that it will fit on the page.)
</para>

<para>
The meanings of the fields in the above log line is as follows:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para>
The 1st field is the date and time at which the job was submitted.  In
this case the date is November 15th, 1996.  The time is 1:14pm.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The 2nd field is the job id.  This job was submitted to the group
called <literal>rotate</literal>.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The 3rd field is the printer it was printed on.  This job was printed on
the printer named <literal>chipmunk</literal> which is presumably a member of the group
<literal>rotate</literal>.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The 4th field is the name of the person who printed it.  This is the
name as it appeared in the queue listing and on banner pages.  This is a
quoted field.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The 5th field is the name of the Unix user who invoked <command>ppr</command> to
submit the job.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The 6th field is the argument to <command>ppr</command>'s <option>-X</option> switch, if it was
used.  In this case it wasn't used, so the field contains a string of
zero length.  This is a quoted field.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The 7th field is the number of logical pages in the job.  This ought
to be the number of <literal>%%Page:</literal> comments in the PostScript
file.  If the number of pages is unknown this field will contain the value -1.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The 8th field is the number of sheets of paper used.  This job was
printed 4-Up in duplex mode so only one sheet was used.  If 5 copies had
been printed, this number would have been 5.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The 9th field is the number of actual pages (sides) printed.  Since this
job prints four reduced-size pages to an actual page, this field is 2.  If
5 copies had been printed, this field would have contained a 10.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The 10th field is the number of seconds which elapsed between the time
the job was queued and the time printing was completed.  (To be more precise,
the interval between when the program <command>ppr</command> was invoked and the time
<command>pprdrv</command> wrote the log entry.)  This job was finished two minutes and 46
seconds after it entered the queue.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The 11th field is the number of seconds between the time <command>pprdrv</command>
started up and the time if wrote the log entry.  It is expressed in seconds
and hundredths of a second.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The 12th field shows the amount of money charged.  This is a fixed point number
with two digits after the decimal point.  No monetary unit is indicated.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The 13th field shows the number of sides the printer says it printed.
This number will likely be obtained though HP PJL.  Note that at this time,
the value in this field is not used to compute the charge in the 12th field.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The 14th field reports the number of pages the printer claimed to have
printed over its lifetime.  This field is -1 if the number was not retrieved.
An attempt to retrieve it will only be made if the printer's configuration
file contains a <literal>PageCountQuery:</literal> line which enables this feature and the
<option>feedback</option> setting is <literal>true</literal>.  When this feature is enabled, the
page count is fetched just after printing the banner page and just before
printing the job itself.  If printing is successful, the resulting value will
ultimately be logged in the 14th field.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>

<para>The 15th field is meaningful only if the value in the 14th field is
not -1.  Once the job has been printed, but before a trailer page is
printed, the page count query is repeated.  If the query is successful, then
the difference between the before and after page counts is logged in this
field. If the query is not performed or is not successful, then a -1 is
loggged in this field.  See the discussion of the
<literal>PageCountQuery:</literal> line in <xref linkend="printer-config"/>
for a discussion of why the value logged in this field may not accurately
reflect the number of pages printed.</para>

</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The 16th field is the size of the PostScript job in bytes.  If the input file
was PostScript, then this is the size of the input file.  If the job had to be
converted to PostScript, then this is the size of the PostScript output of the
filter.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The 17th field is the number of bytes that were sent to the printer in order to
print this job.  This number may be significantly greater than the number in
field 16.  For example, it may have been necessary to print multiple copies by
sending the job several times or <application>PPR</application> may have inserted fonts into the job.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The 18th field is the title of the job.  If the job had no title, then the name
of the input file is used.  If there was no input file (such as if the job was
read from stdin), then this field will be blank.  This is a quoted field.
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
If left uncontrolled, the printlog file will grow indefinitely, so steps should
be taken to truncate it regularly.
</para>

<sect1>
<title>User Notification</title>

<para>
After a job has been printed, an attempt is made to inform the user.  The user
is also informed if a job is rejected, arrested, or canceled.  The agent which
performs the actual communication with the user is called a responder.  A
responder is a small program, generally a shell script, found in the
<filename class="Directory">/usr/ppr/responders/</filename> directory.  No one responder will be appropriate
under all circumstances.  For instance, different responders are used to send
message to Unix shell users and Macintosh clients.
</para>

<para>
The responder to use is chosen when <command>ppr</command> is invoked.  It is chosen with the
<option>-r</option> switch. If no  <option>-r</option> switch is used, the default responder
<literal>write</literal> is
used.  If you wish to suppress user notification you should use the <option>-m
none</option>
switch.
</para>

<para> Among its parameters the responder program is given an address to
send the message to.  The correct format for the address depends on the
responder.  For example, for the responder <literal>write</literal> it is
simply a Unix user name.  For the responder <literal>mail</literal> is it an
electronic mail address.  For the responder <literal>atalk</literal> it is
an AppleTalk network and node number seperated by a colon. The address
should be specified with the <option>-r</option> switch when
<command>ppr</command> is invoked. If the <option>-r</option> switch is
ommitted, the default address, the name of the user who is invoking ppr will
be used.  This address is suitable for the default responder,
<literal>write</literal>.  A list of the supplied responders may be found in
the <ulink url="../refman/ppr.1.html">ppr(1) man page</ulink> in the section
which describes the <option>-m</option> switch. Instructions for writing a
responder are found in Appendix <xref linkend="responders"/>. </para>

<para>
Additional responder options may be specified with <command>ppr</command>'s
<option>--responder-options</option> switch.  These options are a space separated list of
name=value pairs.  If no <option>--responder-options</option> switch is used then the list
will be empty.
</para>

<para>
You can change the default responder, responder address, and responder options
by setting the environment variables <application>PPR</application>_RESPONDER, <application>PPR</application>_RESPONDER_ADDRESS, and
<application>PPR</application>_RESPONDER_OPTIONS respectively.  For example, if you are using X-Windows,
you might want to add the following lines to your
<filename>.xsession</filename> file:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
# Authorize the <application>PPR</application> responder:
/usr/ppr/bin/ppr-xgrant

# Make the xwin responder the default:
<application>PPR</application>_RESPONDER=xwin
<application>PPR</application>_RESPONDER_ADDRESS=$DISPLAY
export <application>PPR</application>_RESPONDER <application>PPR</application>_RESPONDER_ADDRESS
</screen>

</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="progress-reporting">
<title>Progress Reporting</title>

<para>
While a job is being printed, <application>PPR</application> queue listings will show how far along it
is.  Up to three figures are reported.  The first is the percentage of the file
which has been transmitted, the second is the number of the page which is
currently being transmitted (an ordinal with the first page transmitted
being one), the third is the number of pages which the printer reports it
has deposited in the output bin.  (The number of pages in the output bin
will only be reported if the jobbreak method is "pjl" or "signal/pjl".)
</para>

<para> The data which <command>ppop</command> uses to make these reports is
deposited in the job's queue file by <command>pprdrv</command>.  It takes
the form of a line that begins with <literal>Progress:</literal> which
<command>pprdrv</command> appends to the queue file.  This line has three
numbers on it.  The first is the number of bytes written so far.  The second
is the number of <literal>%%Pages:</literal> comments written
so far. The third number is the number of pages which the printer says it
has dropt into the output tray.  All three numbers are padded with leading
zeros so that as they increase their length does not change. </para>

<para>If the job is not printed successfully the first time, provided the
<literal>Progress:</literal> line is still the last line in the file,
<command>pprdrv</command> does not append a new line on the second and
subsequent attempts, rather it overwrites the old one.  If a queue file
contains more than one <literal>Progress:</literal> line, only the last one
should be accepted as correct.  Multiple <literal>Progress:</literal> lines
will generally only be found if a <literal>Reason:</literal> <footnote>
<para> A <literal>Reason:</literal> line is appended each time a job is
arrested. </para> </footnote> line was appended after a
<literal>Progress:</literal> line.</para>

<para>
The percentage of the file transmitted, as reported by
<command>ppop</command>, is obtained
by dividing the number of bytes transmitted by the size of the origional
PostScript file and multiplying the result by 100.  The origional PostScript
file is the input file if it was PostScript or the output of the last filter in
the filter pipeline.  In some cases the percentage indicated when the job is
done is somewhat more or less than 100%. Causes such as the alteration
of DSC comments, the changing of line termination, and the insertion of feature
code will often make a difference of 1% to 5%.  The insertion of
procedure set such as the one for N-Up printing or the downloading of fonts can
result in a total transmission which is several times the size of the origional
file.  Occasionally a job will be printed which has large unnecessary
downloaded fonts.  If these are stript out the result will be that only a small
amount, say 20% of the job will be transmitted.  If switches such as
<option>-s</option> or <option>-p</option> are used to print only a portion of the job the total
percentage printed will be reduced accordingly.  All of these circumstances are
rare, however, so the total printed will almost always be within 5% of
the origional file size.
</para>

<sect1 id="user-name-display">
<title>PJL and User Name Display</title>

<para>
If your printer and interface support it and you use a jobbreak method of
<literal>pjl</literal> or <literal>signal/pjl</literal>, <application>PPR</application> will display the name of the user who
submitted the job being printed on the printer's display panel.
</para>

<para>
If you use PJL with a two-way communications channel to the printer, the printer
will report back whenever it drops a page into the output tray.  These messages
will be used to imcrease the detail of the progress information described in
section <xref linkend="progress-reporting"/>.

<sect1 id="media-handling">
<title>Media Handling</title>

<para>
Modern laser printers very often have multiple input trays.  At the same
time, version 3.0 of the Document Structuring Convention describes a
method whereby the type of medium required for each page in a job may be
specified.
</para>

<para>When a job enters the queue, <application>PPR</application> attempts
to determine what media types are required to print it.  If the document
contains comments which explicitly indicate this, that information is used. 
If not, <application>PPR</application> assumes that only one type of medium
is required and attempts to deduce what that is.  It starts with a default
medium.  The default medium is defined by "default medium =" in the
[internationalization] section of <filename>/etc/ppr/ppr.conf</filename>. 
The default medium should be US Letter or A4. 
<application>PPR</application> then looks for comments in the document setup
section, such as <literal>%%PageSize:</literal> comments and invokations of
the features <literal>*MediaType</literal>, <literal>*MediaColor</literal>,
and <literal>*MediaWeight</literal> which would seem to indicate a
different sort of medium. Each time one of these comments is encountered
<application>PPR</application> revises it idea of what the required medium
is like.</para>

<para>Once the characteristics of all the requested media are determined,
<application>PPR</application> attempts, for each one, to select a medium
known to it that matches the requirements.  The list of known types is
stored in the file <filename>/etc/ppr/media.db</filename>.  For each
required medium type, <application>PPR</application> makes multiple passes
over the known media list, relaxing its standards each time until if finds a
match.  If the proofmode is <literal>NotifyMe</literal> and <application>PPR</application>
has to relax its standards more than a little, it will reject the job.  The
list of known media types may be edited with the <command>ppad
media</command> commands.</para>

<para>
For each printer the operator has the option of describing what known media type
is available in each bin or of forgoing automatic media handling entirely.  The
<command>ppad bins</command> series of commands tells <application>PPR</application> what input bins are available.  If the
bin list is empty, <application>PPR</application> assumes that the printer can immediately print any job
queued for it, regardless of what media are required.  If the bin list is not
empty, <application>PPR</application> will not attempt to print a job until all the required media are
mounted on one or more bins.  In the case of a group, the job will be started on
the first member of the group which has the required media in place.
</para>

<para>The operator must indicate what type of medium is in each bin by using
the <command>ppop mount</command> command.  The media currently mounted on
all the bins of a printer or of a group may be seen by using the
<command>ppop media</command> command.  If a job is not being printed
because the required media are not mounted on any candidate printer, its
queue status (as indicated by <command>ppop list</command>) will be "waiting
for media".  A list of the required media will also be displayed.  Media
handling is closely related to but not the same as automatic bin selection
which is described in section <xref
linkend="automatic-bin-selection"/>.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>Automatic Modification of Print Jobs</title>

<para>
The <application>PPR</application> spooler has the ability to modify the print job by inserting PostScript
code to turn on special printer features such as duplex printing, or to select the
bin which contains the required paper.  Features or this sort are described in
this section.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Inclusion of Feature Code</title>

<para>When <command>ppr</command> is invoked, the user may specify the names
of printer features which should be invoked.  These features are specified
with the <option>-F</option> switch. The names are those used in the
printer's PPD file.  These are the same names as appear in the PPD file. 
Here is an example: to print a file called <filename>mydoc.test</filename>
on the printer <literal>myprn</literal> with duplex mode turned on, we would
use this command:</para>

<para>

<screen>
$ ppr -d myprn -F '*Duplex DuplexNoTumble' mydoc.test
</screen>

</para>

<para>
The code for the features selected by <option>-F</option> switches is inserted in the
Document Setup Section of DSC conforming documents.  For documents which do
not conform, the code is inserted at the begining of the document.  The code
to insert is taken directly from the printer's PPD file.
</para>

<para>
When inserted, the code is enclosed in
<literal>%%Begin(End)Feature:</literal> comments.  When the spooler inserts
duplex code, it brackets the duplex code with code to save and restore the
current transform matrix since for at least some printers, the duplex code
given in the PPD file seems to execute "initmatrix".  The two extra lines of
bracketing code generated by the spooler end with the comment
<literal>%PPR</literal>.  When the spooler inserts code requested with the
<option>-F</option>
switch in a DSC conformant document, it inserts it at the top of the document
setup section, right after the automatic bin selection code described in the
next section, unless it is duplex code.  Duplex code is inserted at the very
end of the document-setup section.  This is done to give it a better chance of
overriding duplex setting code already in the document.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="automatic-bin-selection">
<title>Automatic Bin Selection</title>

<para>
Automatic bin selection is a feature which is closely related to media
handling (see section <xref linkend="media-handling"/>), but it
is not the same since it may be disabled for any given job even if media
handling is being used.  Automatic bin selection will only work if media
handling is also used, that is, if the bin list for the printer is not empty.
</para>

<para>
If a print job requires only one type of medium and automatic bin selection
is in effect, then the spooler will insert code in the job to select the
paper tray which contains the required medium. (Does automatic bin selection
work for jobs with multiple media types?  Maybe, but it has not been well
tested.)
</para>

<para>
Since many documents already contains code which influences input tray selection,
automatic tray selection is not always successful.  This is the strategy used:  In
the case of non-conforming documents, the code is inserted at the begining of the
document.  This code will be overridden by any bin select code in the document.
In the case of conforming documents, that is, those with a properly commented
document setup section, the bin select code is inserted at the beginning of the
document setup section.  The likelihood of this code's suceeding depends on
whether the bin select code the document already contains is properly commented.
For example, it works better with Apple's LaserWriter 8 than with earlier versions
of the LaserWriter driver.  LaserWriter 8 encloses the code which selects paper
source and size in standard comments.  These comments allow the spooler to modify
this code.  This is how <application>PPR</application> modifies the code: It removes any
<literal>*InputSlot</literal> code
and changes <literal>*PageSize</literal> code to equivelent
<literal>*PageRegion</literal> code.  The spooler
removes code by placing a percent sign and a space in front of each line,
converting the code into comments.  It also changes the DSC comments it replaces
into ordinary comments by placing a percent sign and space in front of each line.
Thus, you can examine the spooler output and see what code it has replaced. (You
can examine the spooler output by setting up a printer with the interface
<literal>dummy</literal>. If you wish to know what code is being sent to a real printer, set up
the dummy printer with the same options, including PPD file, bins, and mounted
media.)
</para>

<para>Combined with the automatic bin selection feature is the automatic
autoswitch selection feature.  If the bin selected is named
<literal>Upper</literal> or <literal>Lower</literal>, and there is another
bin named <literal>Lower</literal> or <literal>Upper</literal>, the
autoswitch selection feature comes into play.  If the bin with the opposite
name has the same medium mounted, then the automatic tray switch feature is
turned on using the code from the PPD file.  If the opposite bin has a
different type of medium mounted, then the automatic tray switch feature is
turned off using the code from the PPD file.  (The HP 4 series of printers
do not seem to have a command to turn off the automatic tray switch feature.
This should be regarded as a defect.)</para>

<para>
The automatic bin selection feature may be disabled by deleting all of the defined
bins with the <command>ppad bins delete</command> command.  It may be suppressed for the current
job with <command>ppr</command>'s <option>-B false</option> switch.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Multiple Copies</title>

<para>
The spooler can insert code to change the number of copies of a document
which are printed.  You may ask to have this code inserted by using the
<option>-n</option>
switch when invoking <command>ppr</command>.
</para>

<para>
If the document is DSC conforming, the code to
select the number of copies is inserted at the end of the Document Setup
Section.  If the document sets the number of copies, the code inserted by
the spooler, coming later in the document, will override it.  Of course, if
a job sets the number of copies after the end of the Document Setup
Section, this technique will not work.  (A document which defines the number
of copies outside the Document Setup Section breaks the rules of DSC
conformance.)
</para>

<para>If a document does not have the DSC comments necessary to identify
the Document Setup Section, the code is inserted at the top of the document. 
This code takes a different form from that inserted in a Document Setup
Section: the code redefines <command>showpage</command> as a procedure which
sets the number of copies before executing the real showpage.</para>

<para>If you invoke ppr with the <option>-n collate</option> switch, then
<application>PPR</application> will print collated copies.  It will do this
by either sending the whole document multiple times, for non DSC conforming
documents, or by sending only the pages multiple times, for DSC conforming
documents.  The number of copies desired as well as collated copies may also
be requested by means of a <literal>%%Requirements:</literal>
comment in the document header if the <option>-R copies</option> switch
was used when invoking <command>ppr</command>.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>N-Up Printing</title>

<para><application>PPR</application> can insert code to cause several
virtual pages to be printed on one physical page, possibly reducing the size
of the pages in order to do so. This feature may be invoked with the
<option>-N <replaceable>n</replaceable></option> switch where
<replaceable>n</replaceable> indicates the number of virtual pages to be put
on each side of the physical page.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Signature Printing</title>

<para>A signature is a booklet-like unit of a book which is sewn or glued
together with other signatures to make a book complete.  A signature is
printed in such a way that the sheets of paper on which it is printed may be
stacked and folded in the center.  When they are thus folded and glued,
stapled, or sewn at the fold, the pages will be in the correct order. 
<application>PPR</application> can print a DSC conforming document as one or
more signatures.  2-Up mode is used to accomplish this. The pages are
re-ordered before they are sent to the printer.  It is necessary to send the
pages to the printer out of sequence so that when the signatures are folded
the pages will be in the correct order. Signiture printing is invoked with
the <option>-s</option> switch.  This switch takes an argument which is the
number of sheets of paper which should be used to make each signature.  This
switch also turns on 2-Up mode and duplex mode.  The number of pages which
will fit in a signature is the number of sheets multiplied by 4.</para>

<para>Signiture printing works best with a duplex printer, however it is
possible to print signatures without a duplex-capable printer.  The
<option>-s fronts</option> and <option>-s backs</option> switches make this
possible.  It will be necessary to submit the job once, with the <option>-s
fronts</option> switch (in addition to the <option>-s</option> switch which
specifies the number of sheets); take the paper from the output tray, turn
it around, and put it back in the input tray, and submit the job again with
the <option>-s backs</option> switch.  This works, but it is tricky since
you must first make sure no one else is using the printer, and figuring out
which way to insert the paper the second time is not easy.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Booklet Printing</title>

<para>Booklet printing is just like signature printing, except
<application>PPR</application> automatically selects the minimum number of
signature sheets needed to print the entire document in one booklet. 
Booklet mode is invoked with the <option>-s booklet</option> switch.  As
with signature mode, booklets can be printed on a simplex printer by passing
the paper through twice the first time with the <option>-s fronts</option>
switch and the second time with the <option>-s backs</option> switch.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Page Reversal</title>

<para>
<application>PPR</application> can often re-order the pages of a document so that they will stack in the
proper order in a printer's face-up output tray.  In the case of duplex and N-Up
printing, <application>PPR</application> will work back and forth through the document and will generate
blank pages where necessary in order to achieve correctly stacked output.  The
desired output order for a printer may be specified with the <command>ppad
outputorder</command>
command.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Automatic Resource Downloading</title>

<para>Whenever <application>PPR</application> prints a job which contains
<literal>%%Include:</literal> comments it attempts to insert
the resources requested.  There are three sources of resources available to
<application>PPR</application>.</para>

<para>One source is the resource library in the directory <filename
class="Directory">/usr/ppr/cache/</filename>.  These several procedure sets
used by <application>PPR</application>, a few vendor's procedure sets which
are included because there are broken versions out there which we don't want
corrupting the cache, and a few patched vendor procedure sets.</para>

<para>
The second source is the font index.
[This section has not been written yet.]
</para>

<para>The third source is the resource cache in <filename
class="Directory">/var/spool/ppr/cache/</filename>. Whenever
<application>PPR</application> processes a job with an resource it does not
have in the cache, it adds a copy of it to the cache.  The purpose of this
is to reduce resource download time in the future.  <application>LaserWriter
8</application> will generally refrain from downloading a font if the
<application>PPR</application> <application>Macintosh printer
server</application> <command>papsrv</command> informs it that the font is
already in the printer.  (Of course, it is in the printer, it is in the
cache, but from the viewpoint of the Macintosh client it is the same thing.)
Also, some PostScript drivers for <systemitem class="OSname">Microsoft
Windows</systemitem> allow the downloading of the procedure set to be turned
off.  As long as one job has been printed with it turned on, the procedure
set will be in the cache and if downloading is subsequently turned off, the
<systemitem class="OSname">MS-Windows</systemitem> driver will include a
comment in each document telling where to re-insert the procedure set from
the cache.</para>

<title>Font Substitution</title>

<para>Sometimes a font manufacturer changes the name of a font.  For
example, MonoType's font <literal>MBembo</literal> became
<literal>Bembo</literal>.  At other times, fonts within the same family will
differ only in width.  In that case, a reasonable substitute may be achieved
by adjusting the width of the substitute font.</para>

<para>If the required fonts are called out with DSC comments, then
<application>PPR</application> can automatically substitutes fonts.  The
file <filename>fontsub.conf</filename> is consulted to help locate a
suitable substitute font.</para>

<para>

<sect1 id="interfaces1">
<title>Printer Interface Programs</title>

<para>
The <command>pprdrv</command> communicates with the printer through an interface program.
An interface program must read the PostScript code from stdin and send it to
the printer.  If the interface receives messages from the printer it must copy
them to stdout.
</para>

<para>
An interface may also have a r&ocirc;le in indicating to the printer were
one PostScript job begins and another ends.  For example, if a flag page is
printed before the job it is necessary that the PostScript interpreter be reset
after processing the code for the banner page and before processing the
code for the job proper.  Otherwise, commands executed to print the banner page
could have lingering effects which would prevent the job printing correctly.
With flag pages printed after the job, the problem is even more severe. If an
error occurs in the job, the PostScript interpreter will throw away the rest of
the job, and since it has know way of knowing when the job ends and the banner
page begins it will throw away the flag page too.  Even if the job prints
correctly, if it leaves the device space transformed or standard commands
redefined, the flag page may not print correctly.
</para>

<para>The method used to indicate job boundaries to the printer is known as
the job break method.  The job break method for a printer may be set with
the <command>ppad jobbreak</command> command.  There are four basic
catagories of job break methodes:</para>

<para>There are two unsatisfactory jobbreak methods provided for testing
purposes.  One is a job break method <literal>none</literal>.  As its name
implies, it does not attempt to indicate job boundaries.  It will seldom if
ever prove satisfactory.  On a serial connexion, for example, the printer
will be unable to distinguish sucessive jobs.  With some interfaces it may
work because the very act of starting the interface indicates the start of a
new job.  This may be true of interfaces which invoke Ghostscript or
interfaces which make network connexions using certain protocols such as
AppleTalk. However even in these cases, the job break method
<literal>none</literal> will cause problems if banner or trailer pages are
printed or if <application>PPR</application> elects to print multiple copies
of the job by sending the whole job multiple times.</para>

<para>The other unsatisfactory method is called
<literal>save/restore</literal>.  This is only a slight improvement on
<literal>none</literal>.  When using the <literal>save/restore</literal> job
break method <command>pprdrv</command> brackets each job with the PostScript
commands <command>save</command> and <command>restore</command>.</para>

<para>The job break methods in the second catagory employ the control
character control-d (character code 4) to separate jobs.  If the method is
<literal>control-d</literal>, <command>pprdrv</command> sends a control-D to
terminate any old job which may be lingering in the printer and then sends
the jobs one at a time, ending each job with a control-D.</para>

<para>When a PostScript printer receives a control-D over a serial interface
or, in the case of HP printers with JetDirect cards, over a TCP/IP
interface, it finishes processing the job and then responds with a
control-D.  Thus when all the jobs have been completed, the number of
control D's received should equal the number sent.  A good printer interface
program will count the number of control-D's it copies to the printer and
will keep the connexion open until it receives an equal number.  Only by so
doing can it know that the jobs have been completely processed and that it
has received all of the messages (such as PostScript error notifications)
that are coming.  If the communictions channel is in fact one-way it will
never receive any control-D's and will wait forever. For this reason it is
necessary to set the queue up corectly with the <command>ppad
feedback</command> command.  See the <ulink
url="../refman/ppad.8.html">ppad(8) man page</ulink> for further information
on this topic.</para>

<para>The job break method <literal>pjl</literal> is the same as
<literal>control-d</literal> except that it adds HP PJL commands to display
the user name on the printer's message panel and to turn on reporting of
page completion (see sections <xref linkend="user-name-display"/> and <xref
linkend="progress-reporting"/>).</para>

<para>Two more job break methods depend on the interface to indicate job
breaks to the printer.  These are <literal>signal</literal> and
<literal>signal/pjl</literal>.  Whenever a job break is required,
<command>pprdrv</command> finishes sending the current job to the interface
and then sends the interace SIGUSR1.  When the interface receives SIGUSR1,
it reads all it can from <command>pprdrv</command>, sends it to the printer
and then indicates the job break to the printer.  When the printer has
acknowledged the job break, the interface will send SIGUSR1 to
<command>pprdrv</command>.  This method is implemented by the interface
<literal>atalk</literal> which indicates the division between
jobs to the printer by means of a special feature of the AppleTalk Printer
Access Protocol.</para>

<para>The final job break method is <literal>newinterface</literal>.  When using this method,
<command>pprdrv</command> runs the interface repeately, once for each actual print job or
flag page.  This was used by the now obsolete <literal>gs*</literal> interfaces. 
It may be used in the future to support AppSocket.  It will also work with
<literal>atalk</literal>, but it is more effecient and reliable to use
<literal>signal</literal></para>

<sect1>
<title>Printer Fault Handling</title>

<para>
This topic has already been touched on in section <xref
linkend="printer-errors"/>.  It is the responsibility of the interface program to
connect to the printer, accept the data and send it to the printer.  If it cannot
accomplish its job it will exit with a code which indicates the reason for the
failure.  It will generally also append a diagnostic message to the printer's
alert log.
</para>

<para>
One of these codes is EXIT_PRNERR.  This code indicates that an error has
occured which prevents effective communication with the printer, but the error
is of a sort that may clear up.  The first time such an error occurs, <command>pprd</command>
will wait for 10 seconds and then try printing again.  After each failure the
delay time is increased by 10 seconds until it reaches 10 minutes after which
point it does not continue to increase.  Errors of this sort may result in
alert message being sent to an operator.
</para>

<para>
Another code is EXIT_PRNERR_NORETRY.  This code is similiar to the one
above, but it is used for conditions which are unlikely to be self correcting.
An invalid printer address or interface option is an example of such an error.
These errors too may result in an alert message being sent to an operator.
</para>

<para>
A third code is EXIT_SIGNAL.  An interface should terminate with this code
if it catches the TERM signal.  When a printer is halted or a printing job is
canceled, <command>pprdrv</command> sends SIGTERM in order to kill the interface.  An
interface is not required to have a handler for this signal since the default
action is to die, but if the interface has any special shutdown action it must
take, it should catch this signal and then exit with the code EXIT_SIGNAL.
</para>

<para>
A fourth code is EXIT_ENGAGED.  An interface should exit with this code if
has good reason to believe that the printer is present and turned on but is
busy printing a job from another computer or is off-line.  When an interface
exits with this code, <command>pprd</command> delays for 60 seconds and then tries again.  No
alert notice will be sent to the operator.

<title>Commentators</title>

<para>Note: everything in this chapter will soon be obsolete.</para>

<para>
A commentator is a file or external program which is fed information which
allows it to keep up a running commentary on the activities of <application>PPR</application> as they
relate to a certain printer.
</para>

<para>
A commentator may be activated full-time for a certain printer.  In this case,
it will send messages whenever a selected event occurs on a specific printer
queue regardless of whose job is being printed.
</para>

<para>
In contrast, a user can ask for commentary at the time he submits a job.  The
commentary messages will only be sent while that job is printing and no matter
which printer it is printed on.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Activating a Full-Time Commentator</title>

<para>
A full-time commentator may be activated by editing a printer's configuration
file and adding a line like this one:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
Commentator: 5 audio yourpc.trincoll.edu:15009 "level=3 voice=male1"
</screen>

</para>

<para>
or like this:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
Commentator: 15 samba yourpc ""
</screen>

</para>

<para>In the first example, whenever something interesting happens (what is
interesting is defined by the number 5) the program
<filename>/usr/lib/ppr/commentators/audio</filename> is invoked.  In the second example, the
number which descibes what the commentator wants to hear about is different.
The commentator program is also different:
<filename>/usr/ppr/commentators/samba</filename>
will be invoked.  You may put as many <literal>Commentator:</literal> lines in a printer
configuration file as you wish.
</para>

<para>
In these examples, the first parameter, (5 and 15 in the examples) is a
bitmask which defines what we find interesting.  You should determine
this value by adding together the values which stand for the types of
events you are interested in.  The value 5 is formed by adding 1, for
printer errors, and 4 for printer stalls.
</para>

<para>
Here are the values which should be added together to form the first parameter:
</para>

<para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>

<para>
COM_PRINTER_ERROR 1

<para>
1) The address from the third field of the <literal>Commentator:</literal> line.

</para>
</listitem>

<para>
5) A very brief text message describing the event.

</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
6 and 7) An unprocessed or raw form of the information in the text
message.  At times the raw data fields will contain information which
is not preserved in the fifth argument.

</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
8) <application>PPR</application>'s assessment of the serverity of the situation.  This
assessment takes the form of a number between 1 and 10 with 1 being
not at all serious and 10 being very serious (something that will
probably require the attention of the system administrator.)

</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
9) A longer text message describing the problem in complete sentences.
This messages can be used by simple commentators instead of creating their
own messages from the information provided by means of the arguments described
above.

</para>
</listitem>

</orderedlist>

</para>

<para>
Thus, a commentator might be invoked like this:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
commentators/audio yourpc.trincoll.edu:15009 'level=3 voice=male1' \
	yourprn 4 'stalled for 12 minutes' 'WRITE' '23'

</para>

<para>
when the printer has not been accepting data or like this:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
commentators/audio yourpc.trincoll.edu:15009 'level=3 voice=male1' \
	yourprn 4 'no longer stalled' 'WRITE' '-12'
</screen>

</para>

<para>
when it begins accepting data again, or like this:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
commentators/samba yourpc "" yourprn 8 'has printed a job' EXIT_PRINTED "" 1
</screen>

</para>

<para>
whenever a job is printed, or like this:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
commentators/samba yourpc "" yourprn 8 "job error" EXIT_JOBERR ""
</screen>

</para>

<para>
if there is something wrong with a job, or like this:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
commentators/samba yourpc "" yourprn 8 "PostScript error" EXIT_JOBERR ""
</screen>

</para>

<para>
when the specific thing wrong with the job is a PostScript error, or like
this:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
commentators/samba yourpc "" yourprn 8 "interface program killed" EXIT_SIGNAL ""
</screen>

</para>

<para>
when somebody kills the interface program, or like this:
</para>

<para>

<screen>

</para>

<para>

</para>

<para>

<screen>
commentators/samba yourpc "" yourprn 1 "out of paper" "Out of Paper" 0
</screen>

</para>

<para>
In this example, the first raw data field contains a message received from the
printer.  The normal message field contains a standard version of this
message.  (Believe it or not, printers don't all phrase these messages the
same.)  The various forms are converted to standardized forms using the
information in the file <filename>/etc/ppr/lw_messages.conf</filename>.
</para>

<para>

<screen>
commentators/samba yourpc "" yourprn 1 "" "Fatal error 1001" 0
</screen>

</para>

<para>
Notice that in this last example the field which ought to contain the message
for the user is blank.  However, first raw data field contains the message
exactly as it was received from the printer.  Apperenly, <application>PPR</application> did find a
standard form of this message in its data files.
</para>

<para>
Also notice that in the last two examples the second raw data field is blank.
The second raw data field is currently blank for this type of message but in a
future version of <application>PPR</application> will contain the translated version of this message from
the printer's PPD file.  The language will be indicated by the first word of
the message.
</para>

<para>
If the program name in the printer configuration file is <literal>file</literal>, the event is
appended to the file which is named in the address field.  When the file is
opened, the <application>PPR</application> home directory, (usually /usr/ppr) is the current directory.
You can rely on this or you can begin your file name with a <filename>/</filename>.  If the
commentator program name is not <literal>file</literal> and does not begin with a
<filename>/</filename>, it is
understood to be a program in the <filename
class="Directory">/usr/ppr/commentators/</filename> directory.  If
you want to use a program in another directory, you must begin its name with a
<filename>/</filename>.  Commentators should exit as soon as possible because <command>pprdrv</command> will
wait for up to 60 seconds for all the commentators it has launced to exit.  If
necessary, commentators should place their work in the background or in a queue
and then exit.

<title>The Audio Commentator</title>

<para>This is the most elaborate commentator by far.  It makes spoken
announcements concerning the printer's condition.  To use the audio
commentator you must have Perl 5.  You must also install the sound files. 
To install the sound files, get <filename>ppr-speach-1.30.tar.gz</filename>
and unpack it in the <application>PPR</application> home directory (which is
usually <filename class="Directory">/usr/ppr/lib/</filename>).  To set up
the audio commentator you need a commentator line like this one:</para>

<para>

<screen>
Commentator: 13 audio /dev/xxx level=8
</screen>

</para>

<para>
Or like this one:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
Commentator: 13 audio smith.pc.myorg.org:15009 level=10
</screen>

</para>

<para>Both these lines This will cause events of certain types (indicated by
the bitmask 13 or 31) to be reported using the audio commentator.  The
commentator is also passed the option <literal>level=10</literal> which it
uses to furthur filter the events which have been selected by the bitmask. 
A level of 10 will result in the reporting of all events, even the successful
printing of a job.  Lower numbers will exclude mundane events.  Remember,
the bitmask is formed by summing the desired catagories of messages.  The
catagories are:</para>

<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term>1</term>
<listitem>
<para>
printer errors, such as paper jams

<listitem>
<para>

</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

</variablelist>

<para>The address indicates the means of playing the sound file.  The
current version of the audio commentator provides two ways to do this.  If
the address begins with <filename>/</filename>, as in the first example, then the sound is
played on the local machine.  The code to accomplish this is in the file
<filename>/usr/ppr/lib/play_local.pl</filename>.  This code is
presently very redimentry and requires a program which will take the name of
the file to be played as its argument.  As distributed, the program
<filename>/usr/local/bin/play</filename> is used and the address is ignored. 
Because the address is ignored, the silly address <literal>/dev/xxx</literal> is used in
the example above.  Any help with improving this would be greatly
appreciated.</para>

<para>Whatever method of playing the sound you select, the easiest way to
test the commentator is to set the bitmask to 31, the options to
<option>level=10</option> and print a job. You should hear something such
as, "The printer emm cee ee cee underscore one has just printed a
document."</para>

<sect1>
<title>Input Filters</title>

<para>
One of the most noteworthy features of <application>PPR</application> is its ability to determine the
type of the input file and automatically convert it to PostScript if
necessary.  The type of the input file is determined by two methods.  The first
method is the most reliable.  The second is employed only if the first fails.
</para>

<para>
The first method is to look for a "magic number" at the start of the
file.  Many file format specifications dictate that files conforming to them
always begin with certain signature bytes.  Formats which specify a signature
or magic number include DSC conforming PostScript, JFIF, GIF, PNG, DVI,
WordPerfect documents, PBM, XPM and others.
</para>

<para>
If no recognized magic number is found, then the first 8192 bytes of the
file are scanned and the number of times certain characters and constructs are
found are counted.  The things counted include ASCII control characters,
non-ASCII characters, HP escape sequences, Troff-style dot commands, TeX style
backslash commands, and PostScript procedure definitions.  When these things
have been counted, the totals are used to try to guess at the file format.
</para>

<para>
If <application>PPR</application> ever fails to determine a file's format correctly or you wish to
print a file in a format for which auto-detection is not available, you can
override the auto-detection mechanism with <command>ppr</command>'s
<option>-T</option> switch
<footnote>

<para>
See the
ppr(1) man page for details.
</para>

</footnote>
.
</para>

<para>
Once the file format has been determined, unless it is PostScript, it is
necessary to pass the file through a filter.  A <application>PPR</application> filter is a program which
reads the file from its standard input and writes PostScript on its standard
output.  It is the PostScript code emmited by the filter that <application>PPR</application> sends to the
printer.
</para>

<para>
A number of filters are supplied with <application>PPR</application>.  <application>PPR</application> also includes a number of
shell and Perl scripts which work together with programs such as TeX, Troff,
PBMPlus, and other programs often found on Unix systems to form filters.  If
the supporting programs can not be found, the script filters will not be
installed.
</para>

<para><application>PPR</application> can automatically recognize a number of
file types for which it does not have filters. 
<application>PPR</application> determines whether it has a filter for a file
of a certain type by looking in the <filename
class="Directory">/usr/lib/ppr/filters/</filename> directory for a file with
a name in the form
<filename>filter_<replaceable>type</replaceable></filename>.  For
instance, if the input file is of type <literal>fortran</literal>, it will
look for <filename>/usr/ppr/filters/filter_fortran</filename>.  You
may write your own filters and install them in the <filename
class="Directory">/usr/lib/ppr/lib/</filename> directory.  For explicit
information on writing filters, see Appendix <xref
linkend="filters"/>.</para>

<para>Each filter receives a list of filter options.  This option list is
created by concatenating the default filter options with all of the filter
options specified with <command>ppr</command>'s <option>-o</option> switch. 
Before invoking the filter, <command>ppr</command> culls the option list. 
It removes any option which is intended to apply only to a specific filter
other than the one being used.  An option may be applied to a single filter
by prefixing its name with the name of the filter and a hyphen.  For
example, the option <option>noisy=yes</option> should apply to all filters
and hence won't be culled but the option <option>dvi-noisy=yes</option> will
be deleted by <command>ppr</command> except when it is invoking the DVI
filter.  A filter, such as the <literal>tex</literal> filter, may invoke
another filter such as the <literal>dvi</literal> filter to do part of its
work.  The first filter will generally pass its options on to the second
filter, however, since the filter list has already been culled, the DVI
filter will receive options whose names begin with "tex-" but will not
receive options whose names begin with "dvi-" <footnote>

<para>
More on the handling of the option list can be found in Appendix
<xref linkend="filters"/> and in the ppr(1) man
page in the section which describes the <option>-o</option> switch.

hexdump</option> switch was used
when invoking <command>ppr</command> or if it was not possible to inform the user of the
problem by means of a message on stderr or by invoking a resonder

<title>The TeX Source Filter</title>

<para>This filter is written in Perl, so it will not be available if Perl
was not installed last time you ran <command>ppr-index filters</command>.
This filter will read the input file and attempt to identify it as either
Plain TeX or LaTeX.  It will then copy the file to a temporary directory and
run TeX on it with either the Plain or LaTeX macros.  It will run TeX
multiple times if it is necessary to get the cross references right.</para>

<para>If running TeX results in a fatal error, TeX's output is passed
through the Line Printer Emulator and becomes the output of the filter and
hence what gets printed.  On the other hand, if TeX ran successfully, the
DVI file is passed to the DVI filter.</para>

<para>
This filter has one option, <option>noisy=</option>.  If
<option>noisy=</option> is set to <literal>true</literal> then
progress messages and the terminal output of TeX are printed on stderr.  The
<option>noisy=</option> option is also passed through to the DVI filter.  (This filter passes
all of its options on the the DVI filter, the DVI filter will ignore those it does
not understand.)  Remember, if you intend an option to apply only to this filter
and the instance of the DVI filter which it invokes, you should prefix
"tex-" to
the option name even if you want the option to be passed through to the DVI
filter.  For example, if you invoke <command>ppr</command> with the option
<option>-o 'noisy=false
tex-noisy=true'</option> then the DVI filter will be quiet if you submit a DVI file but
will print noisy messages if you submit a LaTeX file to <command>ppr</command>.

<title>The Texinfo Filter</title>

<para>
This filter is a shell script which converts documents from the Texinfo
format used by the GNU project to PostScript.  It first passes them through
texi2dvi (which you must provide).  It then passes the resulting DVI file
through the DVI filter.</para>

<para>
This filter supports the option <option>noisy=</option>.  If one uses a command such as:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
$ ppr -d aardvark -o noisy=yes
</screen>

</para>

<para>
a running commentary will be printed as the file is converted.  This commentary
includes whatever TeX sends to stdout.  The <option>noisy=</option> option is also passed
on to the DVI filter, so it produces lots of messages too, including the
terminal output of DVIPS.

<title>The DVI Filter</title>

<para>This filter is a shell script which converts TeX DVI files to PostScript. It
uses the program DVIPS to do this.  Unfortunately DVIPS was not designed to use
PPD files, rather it uses a printer configuration file format of its own.  The
<application>PPR</application> DVI filter generates these configuration files automatically.  Once
generated, a DVIPS configuration file is stored in
<filename class="Directory">/var/spool/ppr/dvips/</filename>.  The file's name contains the MetaFont mode, the
resolution, and the amount of free memory in the printer.  These values will
also appear in the appropriate places in the configuration file.  The DVI
filter obtains these values from its options.  The options
<option>resolution=</option>,
<option>freevm=</option>, and <option>mfmode=</option> are among the automatically supplied to augment
any the user specifies by invoking <command>ppr</command> with the
<option>-o</option> switch.  The
automatically generated options are regenerated every time a printer's PPD file
is changed.  The options are stored in the <literal>DefFiltOpts:</literal> line in the printer's
or group's configuration file.
