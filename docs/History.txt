This file contains a history of changes to the PPR documentation which occured

1.40a4, 12 November 1998--12 November 1998

  man pages and the HTML versions of the SGML documents in $(SHAREDIR)/man
  and $(SHAREDIR)/htmldocs.

* Moved fontsub.5.pod back into pprdoc.sgml.  This was done because the font
  substitute file is not considered something that ordinary system
  administrators are likely to modify.

* Moved TODO.txt into this file.

* Created fix_figures, a Perl script which fixes the output of sgml2html so
  that figures work correctly as GIF files.

  to emphasize the use of switchsets as the perfered method of setting options.

1.40a6, 7 April 1999--22 July 1999

  program as explained in pprdoc.sgml.

* Removed references to the Xerox job ticketing driver from ppr2samba.8.pod.

* Added documentation for new interfaces, including parallel which was somehow
  omitted from the 1.32 documentation.

* Added documentation for --routing (previously only -i), -R routing,
  and -R ignore-routing.

* Described changes to ppr2samba.

* Divided index.html into multiple index.html files in the various
  documentation directories.

* Started converting the man pages into a "Reference Manual".

* Dropt UPRINT.1.man from the list of files installed as man pages since it
  is not realy a man page at all.

* Removed "PassThru types:" from the sample "ppad show" output and re-ordered
  the lines the reflect changes to the command's actual output in
  pprinst/pprinst.sgml.
