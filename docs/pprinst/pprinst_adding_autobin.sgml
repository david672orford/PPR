<Title>Automatic Bin Selection
</Title>

<Para>
You must decide if you want to use PPR's automatic bin selection features on
a certain printer.  If you do, you must specify the names of the bins on the
printer and the type of paper in each bin.  If you do not tell PPR that the
printer has bins, PPR will ignore the subject.  It will assume that
the printer has the proper paper to print any job you throw at it.  If you tell
PPR the name of each bin and the kind of paper, PPR will scrutenize each job
and print it only when the required paper is mounted on one of the bins.
</Para>

<Para>
The easiest way to tell PPR what bins the printer has is to instruct it to read the
list from the PPD file.  The command to do this is:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
# ppad bins ppd myprn
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
When this is done, you can view the list you got with the command
<Command>ppad show</Command>:

<Para>

not chosen to install:

<Screen>
# ppad bins delete myprn Envelope
# ppad bins delete myprn Lower
</Screen>
