<title>Adding Printers to the Spooler</title>

<para>Printers may be added without stopping the
<application>PPR</application> spooler.  A new printer queue is created
using the command <command>ppad interface</command>.  This command sets the
interface program and address for a printer queue.  An interface is a the
program which <application>PPR</application> uses to communicate with the
printer.  A good example is the one called <literal>atalk</literal>.  The
<literal>atalk</literal> interface allows <application>PPR</application> to
print on <productname>Apple LaserWriters</productname> and other printers
which implement Apple's Printer Access Protocol (PAP), such as many QMS and
HP printers.</para>

<para>Interface may sometimes require the settings of options in addition to
the address.  In the sections below, a few of the more often required
options will be mentioned, but you may later wish to have a look at the <ulink
url="../refman/ppad-interfaces.8.html">ppad-interfaces(8) manpage</ulink>
which is the definitive reference for interface programs and their options.
It also describes additional interface programs which are not mentioned
here.</para>

<sect3 id="adding-inteface-atalk">
<title>Adding a Printer With an AppleTalk Interface</title>

<para>Before you can add an AppleTalk connected printer to
<application>PPR</application> you must
determine its complete AppleTalk name.  The complete AppleTalk name has
three parts.  The first is the printer's individual name, this is the name
you see in the Macintosh Chooser. The second part is the AppleTalk type
which is almost certainly <literal>LaserWriter</literal>.  The third part is
the AppleTalk zone which you can also find in the Chooser.  HP printers with
Jetdirect cards will list their AppleTalk names and zones on the test page. 
Having determined this informatoin we put it all together as part of the
<command>ppad interface</command> command, like so:

<screen>
# ppad interface myprn atalk "Joe's Mac Printer:LaserWriter@CC Zone"
</screen>

Assuming it does not exist already, this command creates a new printer
queue called <literal>myprn</literal>.  Its AppleTalk name, from the
Chooser, is <literal>Joe's Mac Printer</literal>.  The AppleTalk type is
<literal>LaserWriter</literal>. The zone is <literal>CC Zone</literal>.  (If
the printer queue did exist already, its configuration would be modified. 
This will be covered in a later section.)</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="adding-interface-atalk-hiding">
<title>Hiding an AppleTalk Printer</title>

<para>You may wish to prevent Macintosh users from bypassing the
<application>PPR</application> print queue and printing to the printer
directly as they could do if they could choose it in the Chooser.  You can
hinder them by hidding the printer from the Chooser. 
<application>PPR</application> hides an AppleTalk printer from the chooser
by changing its AppleTalk type.  This works because the Macintosh
LaserWriter driver only lists network names with a type of
<literal>LaserWriter</literal>.  If you ask <application>PPR</application>
to hide a printer, then every time it sends a job to the printer it will
check if it is hidden and hide it if it is not.  However, the AppleTalk type
will revert to <literal>LaserWriter</literal> and the printer will thus
become unhidden every time the printer is turned off and back on
again.</para>

<para>To instruct <application>PPR</application> to hide the printer, simply
enter a string other than <literal>LaserWriter</literal> for the
<replaceable>type</replaceable> part of the address.  Whenever
<application>PPR</application> tries to send a job to the printer, it will
first attempt to find it using the type you specify.  If that fails,
<application>PPR</application> will try again using a type of
<literal>LaserWriter</literal>.  If the printer is found with a type of
<literal>LaserWriter</literal> (i.e., it isn't hidden),
<application>PPR</application> will change the type to whatever you
specified.  For example, if we wanted to hide a printer, we could enter its
address using this command:

<screen>
# ppad interface myprn atalk "Joe's Mac Printer:LaserShared@CC Zone"
</screen>

</para>

<para>The exact type name you use to hide a printer matters little unless
you want another spooler to be able to print to it at the same time.  In
that case, you should use the same type name as that spooler will use.  The
type <literal>ATTShared</literal> is compatible with the NCR server for
Macintosh Clients.  The name <literal>LaserShared</literal> is said to be
used by certain Apple spoolers.  When the Windows NT spooler 'captures' a
printer it changes the type name of the printer to the computer name of the
machine the NT spooler is running on. For example, if
<application>PPR</application> is sharing our example printer with an NT
computer name <literal>ALICE</literal> which has captured it, this would be
the command to use:

<screen>
# ppad interface myprn atalk "Joe's Mac Printer:ALICE@CC Zone"
</screen>

</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="adding-inteface-tcpip">
<title>Adding a TCP/IP Connected Printer</title>

<para>The interface <literal>tcpip</literal> can be used to print to TCP/IP
connected printers using the SocketAPI and AppSocket protocols.  HP printers
with <productname>JetDirect</productname> cards implement SocketAPI.  To set
up an <productname>HP 4M+</productname> we might use this command:

<screen>
# ppad interface my4m tcpip my4m.prn.trincoll.edu:9100
</screen>

In this example, <literal>my4m</literal> is the name of the queue we are
creating. <systemitem class="SystemName"> my4m.prn.trincoll.edu</systemitem>
is the DNS name of the printer.  We could have used the IP address instead
if we had wished.  The number <literal>9100</literal> is the port that the
<literal>tcpip</literal> interface should connect to.  (On a JetDirect card
port 9100 accepts a data stream in the same format as the serial or parallel
interface would want.)</para>

<para>We can also use this interface to print to Extended Systems Pocket
Print Servers.  These devices are small boxes with an Ethernet port on one
end and a parallel port connector on the other.  In their default
configuration, they listen for SocketAPI connections on TCP port 9100. 
However, since the parallel port on these print server is unidirectional,
they can only convey data from the spooler to the printer and not from the
printer to the spooler.  Therefore we must tell
<application>PPR</application> not to expect to expect to receive any sort
of data in reply from the printer.  Here are the commands:

<screen>
# ppad interface qmsps410 tcpip qmsps410.prn.trincoll.edu:9100
# ppad feedback qmsps410 false
</screen>

</para>

<para>Setting <option>feedback</option> to <literal>false</literal> if the
communications channel does not support two-way communication is very
important.  If you fail to do so, <application>PPR</application> will almost
certainly attempt operations, such as queries and handshaking, which require
two way communications.  The result will be that the queue will get stuck,
either before printing anything, or after the first job has been printed. 
If this happens, you must forcibly halt the queue, change the setting, and
restart the queue, like this:

<screen>
# ppop halt qmsps410
# ppad feedback qmsps410 false
# ppop start qmsps410
</screen>

</para>

<para>However, you should not get in the habit of setting
<option>feedback</option> to <literal>false</literal> for no reason.  Setups
with <option>feedback</option> set to <literal>false</literal> should be
considered crippled.  If a printer doesn't support two-way communication
with a given interface, such as <literal>tcpip</literal>, you consider other
otherfaces, such as <literal>atalk</literal>.  Among the harmful effects of
lack of two-way communication is that failure of the job due to PostScript
errors will not be detected.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="adding-inteface-simple">
<title>Using a Printer Connected to a Parallel or USB Port (Old Method)</title>

<para><application>PPR</application> provides a simple (even simplistic)
interface program which can be used to communicate with a printer connected
a port on the print server, such as a parallel or USB port.  It is called
<literal>simple</literal>.  When printing through a server port port one
must be sure that the user <literal>ppr</literal> has permission to write to
the port.  This is one way you could set it up a print queue for a parallel
port:

<screen>
# chown ppr /dev/lp0
# chmod 600 /dev/lp0
# ppad interface nearprn simple /dev/lp0
</screen>

</para>

<para>This interface program does not support bidirectional communication,
so <application>PPR</application> will not detect PostScript errors when
printing through this interface.  The default <option>feedback</option>
setting for this interface program is <literal>false</literal>, so there is
no need to set it with <command>ppad feed</command>.  The
<literal>simple</literal> interface program is not able to read the printer
status lines of a parallel port.  These status lines often convey valuable
information such as that the printer is out of paper.  Due these
limitations, you should use the <literal>simple</literal> interface to print
to parallel and USB ports only if the <literal>parallel</literal> and
<literal>usblp</literal> interface programs won't work on your
system.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="adding-inteface-parallel">
<title>Using a Printer Connected to a Parallel Port (New Method)</title>

<para><application>PPR</application> also has an interface program designed
especially for parallel ports. It is called <literal>parallel</literal>. 
When printing through a <hardware>parallel port</hardware> we must be sure
that the user <literal>ppr</literal> has permission to write to the port.
This is one way you could set it up:

<screen>
# chown ppr /dev/lp0
# chmod 600 /dev/lp0
# ppad interface nearprn parallel /dev/lp0
</screen>

</para>

<para>The default for this interface is <option>feedback</option>
<literal>false</literal>.  If your printer and operating system support
bidirectional parallel port operation, then you should definitely inform
<application>PPR</application> of the fact using a command like this one:

<screen>
# ppad feedback nearprn true
</screen>

If you do this, then <application>PPR</application> will be able to detect
job failures due PostScript errors.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="adding-inteface-usblp">
<title>Using a Printer Connected to a USB Port (New Method)</title>

<para><application>PPR</application> provides an interface for USB-connected
printers.  It is still experimental and its features subject to change, so
about all we can say about it is that you might set it up like this:

<screen>
# chown ppr /dev/usb/lp0
# chmod 600 /dev/usb/lp0
# ppad interface nearprn usblp /dev/usb/lp0
</screen>

</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="adding-inteface-serial">
<title>Using a Printer Connected to a Serial Port</title>

<para><application>PPR</application> has an interface called <literal>serial</literal> for sending jobs
to printers connected to the print server's serial ports.  As with the
<literal>parallel</literal> interface, you must set the file permissions on
the device file in the <filename class="Directory">/dev/</filename>
directory so that the user <literal>ppr</literal> can write to the port. 
You will also want to set the baud rate:

<screen>
# chown ppr /dev/tty0
# chmod 600 /dev/tty0
# ppad interface nearprn serial /dev/tty0
# ppad options nearprn 'speed=9600 bits=8 parity=none'
</screen>

</para>

<para> This may well be the most difficult interface to set up because of
the lack of standards for connecting printers to RS-232 ports.  The problem
is that RS-232 was originally designed with but one purpose and that was to
connect a teletype machine to a modem.  It says nothing about connecting
printers to computers.  Thus there is a lack of consistency in the way
RS-232 connection printers implement handshaking and flow control.  To
describe the RS-232 interface, the construction of null modem cables, the
use of breakout boxes for troubleshooting and the quirks of the serial
driver in varous Unix variants would require a document much larger than
this one and is a task to which the author of this document does not feel
himself equal.  Because of the the potential complexity of serial connexions,
this interface has many options, only three of which have been hinted at
in the example above.  The remainder of the options are described in the 
<ulink url="../refman/ppad.8.html">ppad(8) manpage</ulink>.
</para>

<para>RS-232 ports are invariably bidirectional, so the default for
<option>feedback</option> for this interface is
<literal>true</literal>.</para>

<sect3 id="adding-ppd">
<title>Selecting a PPD File</title>

<para>Once the printer has been added, you should choose a PPD file that
accurately describes and inform <application>PPR</application> of your
choice.  Likely you will choose one of the files in <filename
class="Directory">/usr/share/ppr/PPDFiles/</filename>.  The files in this
directory have descriptive names.  A print queue's PPD filename is set with the
<command>ppad ppd</command> command:

<screen>
# ppad ppd myprn "QMS-PS 410"
</screen>

</para>

<para>Using the correct PPD file is very important since the wrong PPD file
can prevent printer features such as multiple input trays and duplexing from
working.  If you cannot find a PPD file which was designed for the precise
make and model of your printer, try to find one that is close.  It is
important not to use the PPD file for a level 2 PostScript printer with a
level 1 PostScript printer.  Also, the PPD file should define the bins which
really exist on your printer and should have the correct code for selecting
them.  Finally, it is best that the font list be correct.  A font list which
leaves some fonts out is probably better than one which names fonts the
printer does not have.  Here are some PPD files you might try if you don't
have anthing closer:

<para>If you can not find anything that is close, the printer manufacturer
may be able to supply a suitable PPD file.  Very often it can be found on

http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/PDFS/TN/5003.PPD_Spec_v4.3.pdf</ulink>. 
That document, together with a good printer manual, will give you the
information you need to write your own PPD file or to modify an existing one
to work with your printer.</para>

<para>Any new PPD files should be converted to Unix line termination (FTP
will do this for you if you transfer them in ASCII mode).  The files already
in <filename class="Directory">/usr/share/ppr/PPDFiles/</filename> have
names that are take from their <literal>*ModelName:</literal> lines.  You
might want to adopt this practice.  You may put new PPD files in a directory
other than <filename class="Directory">/usr/share/ppr/PPDFiles/</filename>,
as long as you specify the path in the <command>ppad ppd</command> command. 
When <application>PPR</application> opens the PPD file, PPD file names
starting with <filename>/</filename> are used as is, others have <filename

them.</para>

<title>Using <application>Ghostscript</application> with <application>PPR</application></title>

<para>Using <application>Ghostscript</application>, a freely available
PostScript interpreter, it is possible to print PostScript jobs on
non-PostScript printers.  This is especially useful for driving inexpensive
inkjet printers connected over parallel or USB cables.  Of course, large
laser printers and network printers will also work.  The only requirement is
that the communications path have sufficient bandwidth to quickly transfer
the large bitmaps produced by <application>Ghostscript</application>.</para>

<para>Previous versions of <application>PPR</application> had special
printer interface wrapper programs which accepted PostScript from PPR,
processed it with <application>Ghostscript</application>, and sent the <application>Ghostscript</application> output to the
printer by using one of the real interface programs.  However, these special
interface wrapper programs are obsolete.  We will describe only the new
mechanism here.</para>

<para><application>PPR</application>assumes that you have installed
<application>Ghostscript</application> and the
<application>Ghostscript</application> printer drivers that you intend to
use. <application>PPR</application> can use any compiled-in
<application>Ghostscript</application> driver as well as CUPS and IJS
drivers including those from HP and the Gimp Print project.</para>

<para>It is easiest to configure a printer queue to use
<application>Ghostscript</application> is to use a special PPD file.  These
PPD files describe the capabilities of the
printer-<application>Ghostscript</application>-driver combination and have a
special line begining with <literal>*pprRIP:</literal> which tells
<application>PPR</application> to use Ghostscript as the RIP (Raster Image
Processor) and which driver and options to select.  For example, these
commands will set up an <productname>Epson Stylus C62</productname> attached
to the first parallel port:

<screen>
# ppad interface color_inkjet /dev/lp0
# ppad ppd color_inkjet "Epson Stylus C62 Ghostscript"

If this selection seems a little limited, it is because these PPD files were
built by hand for the printers which <application>PPR</application>'s author
used.  He hopes to include a broader selection in the future.</para>

<para>If you have <ulink url="http://www.cups.org">CUPS</ulink> installed,
you can use its drivers for HP PCL, Epson-compatible dotmatrix, and Epson
Stylus printers simply by selecting the cooresponding PPD file as supplied

<para><application>PPR</application> understands the extra information in a
<application>CUPS</application>-<application>Ghostscript</application> PPD
file and can invoke the correct driver without additional help.  For
example, if we want to drive a <productname>HP LaserJet 4</productname> that
doesn't have the PostScript option installed, but does have a JetDirect
card, we could set it up with these commands:

<screen>
# ppad interface johnsprn tcpip johnsprn.prn.notacorp.com:9100
# ppad ppd johnsprn /usr/share/cups/model/laserjet.ppd
</screen>

That really is all there is to it.
</para>

<para>We absolutely must mention the Foomatic project.  Foomatic is an effort
to catalog as many printers and Ghostscript drivers as possible in an XML
database.  This database is used to generate PPD file which, when used
together with a special Perl script that invokes Ghostscript, can support a
huge list of printers.  Instructions for using Foomatic with PPR can be
found at <ulink

<para>Your final option for <application>Ghostscript</application> RIP
support is to choose a generic PPD file such as <filename>HP LaserJet 4M
DSC</filename> and then use the <command>ppad rip</command> command to
select the <application>Ghostscript</application> driver and options.  For
