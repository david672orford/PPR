<title>Adding PPR Printers to LAN Manager For Unix</title>

<para> If you are using NCR's <productname>LAN Manager for
Unix</productname>, sometimes refered to as LANMAN/X, you can set it up to
feed jobs to PPR.  A printer is added to LAN Manager with the <command>net
share</command> command.  <productname>LAN Manager for Unix</productname>
can use PPR by means of something called a ``print processor script'':
</para>

<para>

<screen>
# net share myprn /print
# net print myprn /processor:ppr
</screen>

</para>

<para>
These commands create a LAN Manager printer called <literal>myprn</literal> (the same name
as we gave the printer in PPR).  The processor indicated as ``ppr'' is the
script <filename>/var/opt/lanman/customs/ppr</filename> which is installed by the PPR
<command>fixup</command> script.  A group of printers may be added to LAN Manager in the
same way:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
# net share ourgroup /print
# net print ourgroup /processor:ppr
</screen>

</para>

<para>
You could create your own versions of the print processor script to invoke the
program <command>ppr</command> with differents sets of options.  However, it
will generally be more convenient to set options with the <command>ppad
switchset</command>
command as described in section <xref linkend="switchsets"/>.
