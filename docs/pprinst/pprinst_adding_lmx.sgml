<Title>Adding PPR Printers to LAN Manager For Unix</Title>

<Para>
If you are using NCR's LAN Manager for Unix, sometimes refered to as
LANMAN/X, you can set it up to feed jobs to PPR.  A printer is added to LAN
Manager with the <Emphasis remap="bf">net share</Emphasis> command.  LAN Manager can use PPR by means
of something called a ``print processor script'':
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
# net share myprn /print
# net print myprn /processor:ppr
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
These commands create a LAN Manager printer called ``myprn'' (the same name
as we gave the printer in PPR).  The processor indicated as ``ppr'' is the
script <Literal remap="tt">/var/opt/lanman/customs/ppr</Literal> which is installed by the PPR
<Emphasis remap="bf">fixup</Emphasis> script.  A group of printers may be added to LAN Manager in the
same way:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
# net share ourgroup /print
# net print ourgroup /processor:ppr
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
You could create your own versions of the print processor script to invoke the
program <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> with differents sets of options.  However, it
will generally be more convenient to set options with the <Emphasis remap="bf">ppad switchset</Emphasis>
command as described in section <XRef LinkEnd="switchsets">.
