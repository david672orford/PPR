<Title>Adding PPR Printers to LAN Manager For Unix</Title>

<Para> If you are using NCR's <ProductName>LAN Manager for
Unix</ProductName>, sometimes refered to as LANMAN/X, you can set it up to
feed jobs to PPR.  A printer is added to LAN Manager with the <Command>net
share</Command> command.  <ProductName>LAN Manager for Unix</ProductName>
can use PPR by means of something called a ``print processor script'':
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
# net share myprn /print
# net print myprn /processor:ppr
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
These commands create a LAN Manager printer called <Literal>myprn</Literal> (the same name
as we gave the printer in PPR).  The processor indicated as ``ppr'' is the
script <Filename>/var/opt/lanman/customs/ppr</Filename> which is installed by the PPR
<Command>fixup</Command> script.  A group of printers may be added to LAN Manager in the
same way:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
# net share ourgroup /print
# net print ourgroup /processor:ppr
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
You could create your own versions of the print processor script to invoke the
program <Command>ppr</Command> with differents sets of options.  However, it
will generally be more convenient to set options with the <Command>ppad
switchset</Command>
command as described in section <XRef LinkEnd="switchsets">.
