<title><application>PPR</application>'s LPD (RFC 1179) Server</title>

<para>
An LPD server, called <command>lprsrv</command> is provided with PPR.  This server
conforms to the remote printing protocol described in RFC 1179.  When this
server receives a job for a PPR printer, it invokes <command>ppr</command> and passes
the file to it. If <application>PPR</application>'s LPD server receives a job for queue
which is not defined in PPR, it passes the job to the system's normal print
spooler.
</para>

<para><application>PPR</application>'s LPD server is relatively easy to set up since
it simply shares all of your <application>PPR</application> printers and all of the native
spooling system's printers.
</para>

<para>Before using <application>PPR</application>'s LPD server, it is necessary
to disable any LPD server you are currently using.
</para>

<para>Once any pre-existing LPD server is disabled, the
<command>inetd</command> configuration
file may then be changed so that <command>inetd</command> will call
<command>lprsrv</command>
whenever a print request comes in. The setup procedure is described in the
lprsrv(8) man page.
