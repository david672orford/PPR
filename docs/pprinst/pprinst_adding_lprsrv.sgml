<title><application/PPR/'s LPD (RFC 1179) Server</title>

<para>An LPD server, called <command/lprsrv/ is provided with PPR.  This server
conforms to the remote printing protocol described in RFC 1179.  When this
server receives a job for a PPR printer, it invokes <command/ppr/ and passes
the file to it. If <application/PPR/'s LPD server receives a job for queue
which is not defined in PPR, it passes the job to the system's normal print
spooler.</para>

<para><application/PPR/'s LPD server is relatively easy to set up since
it simply shares all of your <application/PPR/ printers and all of the native
spooling system's printers.
</para>

<para>Before using <application/PPR/'s LPD server, it is necessary
to disable any LPD server you are currently using.
</para>

<para>Once any pre-existing LPD server is disabled, the <command/inetd/ configuration
file may then be changed so that <command/inetd/ will call <command/lprsrv/
whenever a print request comes in. The setup procedure is described in the
lprsrv(8) man page.
