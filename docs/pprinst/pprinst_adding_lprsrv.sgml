<title><application>PPR</application>'s LPD (RFC 1179) Server</title>

<para> An LPD server, called <command>lprsrv</command> is provided with PPR. 
This server conforms to the remote printing protocol described in RFC 1179. 
When this server receives a job for a PPR printer, it invokes
<command>ppr</command> and passes the file to it.  If
<application>PPR</application>'s LPD server receives a job for queue which
is not defined in PPR, it passes the job to the system's normal print
spooler. </para>

<para><application>PPR</application>'s LPD server doesn't require much
set up since it simply shares all of your <application>PPR</application>
printers and all of the native spooling system's printers. </para>

<para>Before using <application>PPR</application>'s LPD server, it is
necessary to disable any LPD server you are currently using.  
Once any pre-existing LPD server is disabled, restart <command>pprd</command>
so that it can start accepting connexions on port 515 and launching
<command>lprsrv</command> to handle them.</para>
