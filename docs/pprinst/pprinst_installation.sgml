<title>Obtaining the <application>PPR</application> Source Code</title>

<para>
The <application>PPR</application> source code may be obtained by anonymous FTP from
<ulink url="ftp://ppr-dist.trincoll.edu/pub/ppr/">
ftp://ppr-dist.trincoll.edu/pub/ppr/</ulink>.  If you prefer to use
HTTP, the URL is <ulink url="http://ppr-dist.trincoll.edu/pub/ppr/">
http://ppr-dist.trincoll.edu/pub/ppr/</ulink>.
The file size is about 4 megabytes.

<sect2 id="install-building">
<title>Unpacking, Compiling, and Installing <application>PPR</application></title>

<para>
The <application>PPR</application> source code comes as a tar archive compressed with
gzip. To unpack it use this command:

<screen>
# gunzip -c ppr-X.XX.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</screen>

Where X.XX is the <application>PPR</application> version number.  This
command will uncompress and unpack the source code and deposit it in a
directory called <filename class="Directory">ppr-1.50</filename> which it
will create in the current directory.</para>

<para>
Compiling and installing <application>PPR</application> consists of 4 basic steps:

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Running the <command>Configure</command> script</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Running <command>make</command></para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Running <command>make install</command></para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

These steps are described in detail in the file <ulink
url="../misc/INSTALL.txt"><filename>INSTALL.txt</filename></ulink> which may
be found in the top level source code directory.  There you will find list
the of packages which it is required or recomended that you install before
building and runing <application>PPR</application>.  That file also has and
has notes about how PPR gets along with various operating systems.</para>

<sect2 id="install-default-alert-destination">
<title>Setting a Default Alert Destination</title>

<para>When <application>PPR</application> detects that something is wrong
with a printer, it can inform an operator by e-mail. The e-mail address of
the operator to be informed is specified for each individual printer.  Also
specified is how long a problem must persist before the operator should be
alerted.  There are default settings which are copied into the configuration
of each newly created printer.  As soon as you have installed the spooler
you should set the default alert settings which will be applied to new
printers.  You do it with a command like this one:

<screen>
# ppad new alerts 5 mail alertreaders@myorg.org
</screen>

After this command has been executed, then the configuration of each printer
you add will be set so that on every fifth printer fault a notice will be
mailed to <email>alertreaders@myorg.org</email>.
</para>

<sect2 id="install-filter-setup">
<title>Filter Setup</title>

<para> One of the last things <command>make install</command> does is run
<command>ppr-index filters</command> The <command>ppr-index filters</command>
command searches for certain programs which it will be able to use to
convert files you may want printed to PostScript.  These programs include
<application>Troff</application>, <application>TeX</application>,
<application>DVIPS</application>, the <application>NetPBM</application>
utilities, and the <application>Adobe Acrobat Reader</application>.  For
those that are found in the current path, PPR generates small shell scripts
in <filename>/usr/lib/ppr/filters/</filename>. Later, PPR calls these shell
scripts to automatically convert input files to PostScript.</para>

<para>
If you later add or remove programs which PPR uses or could use as filters,
you should re-run <filename>ppr-index filters</filename>.
</para>

<sect2 id="install-web-interface">
<title>Web Interface Setup</title>

<para>PPR has a web interface which one can use to manage queues and
printers.  This is not yet adequately documented here.  Please see
<filename>www/README.txt</filename> in the PPR source distribution for
instructions on setting this up.</para>
