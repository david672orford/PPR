<title>Obtaining the PPR Source Code</title>

<para>
The <application/PPR/ source code may be obtained by anonymous FTP from
<ulink url="ftp://ppr-dist.trincoll.edu/pub/ppr/">
ftp://ppr-dist.trincoll.edu/pub/ppr/</ulink>.  If you prefer to use
HTTP, the URL is <ulink url="http://ppr-dist.trincoll.edu/pub/ppr/">
http://ppr-dist.trincoll.edu/pub/ppr/</ulink>.
The file size is about 3 megabytes.

<title>Unpacking, Compiling, and Installing PPR</title>

<para>
The <application/PPR/ source code comes as a tar archive compressed with
gzip. To unpack it use this command:

<screen>
# gunzip -c ppr-src-1.50.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</screen>

This will uncompress and unpack the source code and deposit it in a directory
called <filename>ppr-1.50</filename> which it will create in the current directory.
</para>

<para>
Compiling and installing PPR consists of 4 basic steps:

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Running the <command>Configure</command> script</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Running <command>make</command></para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Running <command>make install</command></para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Running the <command>fixup</command> script</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

These steps are described in detail in the file <filename/INSTALL.txt/ which
may be found in the top level source code directory.

<title>Setting a Default Alert Destination</title>

<para>An operator can be informed by email when something goes wrong with a printer.
For each printer, an operator's email address may be specified as well as an
option which indicates how long the problem must persist before the operator is
alerted.  As soon as you have installed the spooler you should set the default
alert settings which will be applied to new printers.  You do it with a command
like this one:

<screen>
# ppad new alerts 5 mail alertreaders@myorg.org
</screen>

After this command has been executed, then the configuration of each printer
you add will be set so that on every fifth printer fault a notice will be
mailed to <email/alertreaders@myorg.org/.

<sect2><title>Filter Setup</title>

<para>
The last thing the <command/fixup/ script does is run the script
<command>/usr/lib/ppr/fixup/fixup_filters</command>.  The
<command/fixup_filters/ script searches for certain programs which it will be
able to use to convert files you may want printed to PostScript.  These
programs include <application/Troff/, <application/TeX/, <application/DVIPS/,
the <application/NetPBM/ utilities, and the <application/Adobe Acrobat Reader/.
For those that are found in the current path, PPR generates small shell scripts
in <filename>/usr/lib/ppr/filters/</filename>. Later, PPR calls these shell
scripts to automatically convert input files to PostScript.
</para>

<para>
If you later add or remove programs which PPR uses or could use as filters,
you should re-run <filename>fixup_filters</filename>.
