<title>Adding <application>PPR</application> Printers to <application>Samba</application></title>

<para>If you are using the SMB server called
<application><application>Samba</application></application> you can use it to share <application>PPR</application> printers.  It
is recomended that you use <application>Samba</application> version 1.9.18 or later.  For information
about obtaining refer to <ulink
url="http://www.samba.org/">http://www.samba.org/</ulink>.</para>

<para>
To share <application>PPR</application> printers through <application>Samba</application>, you must add a few lines to
<application>Samba</application>'s configuration file.  <application>Samba</application>'s configuration file is often called
<filename>/usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf</filename>.
</para>

<para>
Somewhere after the section called <literal>[global]</literal> you should add two lines
which read:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
include = /usr/lib/ppr/lib/smb-protos.conf
include = /etc/ppr/smb-include.conf
</screen>

</para>

<para>
After you have modified <filename>smb.conf</filename>, you should run
<command>ppr2samba</command> which is a utility which creates the file
<filename>/etc/ppr/smb-include.conf</filename>.  This file will contain a
<application><application>Samba</application></application> share
definition section for each printer and group you have set up in <application>PPR</application>.
You should re-run <command>ppr2samba</command> after every time you create or delete a
printer or group in <application>PPR</application>.
</para>

<para>
To allow guest users to have meaningful names in the queue listing and to
delete their jobs, you should add the <application>Samba</application> guest user to the access control
file <filename>/etc/ppr/acl/pprprox.allow</filename>.  All that is needed is a line with
the user name on it.
</para>

<para>
This procedure will share all <application>PPR</application> printers through <application>Samba</application>.  If you want to
exclude certain printers you should refer to the ppr2samba(8) man page.
</para>

<para>You should also refer to <ulink url="../refman/ppr2samba.8.html">the
ppr2samba(8) man page</ulink> if you want to set up special features for
public access computers or if you want to set up <application>Samba</application> so it can offer
printer drivers to <systemitem class="OSname">Microsoft Windows
95</systemitem> clients for automatic installation.</para>
