<title>Replacing a Printer</title>

<para>
Printers are frequently replaced with newer models.  What should the PPR
operator do when this happens?  One solution is to create a whole new queue for
the new printer.  An alternative is to adjust the configuration of the existing
queue so that it points to the new printer.  This latter method may minimize the
disruption experienced by the users of the printer.
</para>

<para>To modify a queues configuration we can use either the <command>ppad</command> command or 
the web interface's Printer Properties window.</para>

<sect2>
<title>Basic Queue Modifications</title>

<para>
In order to correctly modify a queue's configuration, it is necessary to
understand its current configuration. The current configuration may be viewed
with the <command>ppad show</command> command, like this:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
# ppad show sea305
Printer name: sea305
  Comment: QMS-PS 410 in Seabury Room 305
Interface: serial
  Address: "/dev/ttyS0"
  Options: baud=9600 bits=8 parity=none
  JobBreak: control-d (by default)
  Feedback: yes (by default)
  Codes: Clean8Bit (by default)
PPDFile: QMS-PS 410
  Default Filter Options: level=1 colour=False resolution=300 freevm=336596
    mfmode=CanonCX
  Bins:
  OutputOrder: PPD
Alert frequency: 7 (send alert every 7 errors)
  Alert method: mail
  Alert address: alertreaders@mail.trincoll.edu
Flags: no no (banners discouraged, trailers discouraged)
Charge: no charge
Switchset:
</screen>

</para>

<para>If we were to use the web interface, we would see the same information presented in a
series of tabbed pages, as in figure <xref linkend="prn-properties1"/>.</para>

</figure>

<para>
Notice that the printer in this example is currently a QMS-PS 410 connected
through a serial port.  We will replace it with an HP 4M connected over
the AppleTalk network.  To do this, we must modify the settings of the
``Interface'', ``Address'', ``Jobbreak'', ``PPD File'', and, if we want to
do things right, ``Comment''.  First, we will set the new interface and
address:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
# ppad interface sea305 atalk "Seabury Room 305:LaserShared@Seabury Zone"
</screen>

</para>

<para>
Notice that the AppleTalk address is enclosed in quotes.  This is necessary
because it contains spaces.  Also, notice that the device type portion of
the AppleTalk address is ``LaserShared'' rather than ``LaserWriter''.  This
causes PPR to `hide' the printer by automatically changing its device type
from ``LaserWriter'' to ``Laser Shared''; if you don't want this to happen,
use ``LaserWriter'' instead of ``LaserShared''.  Here is what the
configuration looks like now:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
# ppad show sea305
Printer name: sea305
  Comment: QMS-PS 410 in Seabury Room 305
Interface: atalk
  Address: "Seabury Room 305:LaserShared@Seabury Zone"
  Options:
  JobBreak: signal (by default)
  Feedback: yes (by default)
  Codes: Binary (by default)
PPDFile: QMS-PS 410
  Default Filter Options: level=1 colour=False resolution=300 freevm=336596
    mfmode=CanonCX
  Bins:
  OutputOrder: PPD
Alert frequency: 7 (send alert every 7 errors)
  Alert method: mail
  Alert address: alertreaders@mail.trincoll.edu
Flags: no no (banners discouraged, trailers discouraged)
Charge: no charge
Switchset:
</screen>

</para>

<para> Notice that changing the interface from <literal>serial</literal> to
<literal>atalk</literal> automatically changed the <option>jobbreak</option>
setting from <literal>control-d</literal> to <literal>signal</literal> which
is the the default for the <literal>atalk</literal> interface.  This is
fine, but since the new printer is an <productname>HP 4M</productname>, we
might want to use a Jobbreak setting of <literal>signal/pjl</literal>
instead so that we can get nifty messages on the printer's display panel.
We can make the change with this command: </para>

<para>
<screen>
# ppad jobbreak sea305 signal/pjl
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Next, we must change the PPD file:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
# ppad ppd sea305 "HP LaserJet 4M DSC"
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Finally, any good system administrator will change the comment:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
# ppad comment sea305 "HP 4M in Seabury room 305"
</screen>

</para>

<para>This printer did not have bins defined for automatic bin selection but if it had had, we would
have had to alter the bin list to reflect the bins available on the new
printer.  The easiest way to do this would be to execute the command:</para>

<para>
<screen>
# ppad bins ppd sea305
</screen>
</para>

<para>
This would add all possible bins for the new printer.  After doing this it
would have been necessary to use <command>ppad show sea305</command> to display the
configuration and then use several commands along the lines of <command>ppad bins
delete sea305 Envelope</command> to delete optional bins that are not installed
on the new printer and bins that were present on the old printer but are not
present on the new.  Of course, once this is done, it is necessary to use
the <command>ppop mount</command> command to mount media on the new bins.  But, as we
said, this print queue does not have bins defined, so we did not have to do
any of this.  Here we display the final configuration:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
# ppad show sea305
Printer name: sea305
  Comment: HP 4M in Seabury room 305
Interface: atalk
  Address: "Seabury Room 305:LaserWriter@Seabury Zone"
  Options:
  JobBreak: signal/pjl
  Feedback: yes (by default)
  Codes: Binary (by default)
PPDFile: HP LaserJet 4M DSC
  Default Filter Options: level=2 colour=False resolution=600 freevm=709584
    mfmode=ljfour
  Bins:
  OutputOrder: PPD
Alert frequency: 7 (send alert every 7 errors)
  Alert method: mail
  Alert address: alertreaders@mail.trincoll.edu
Flags: no no (banners discouraged, trailers discouraged)
Charge: no charge
Switchset:
</screen>
</para>

<para>Of course, if you are using the web interface you should go through the various tabs and make
the changes described above.  You should then press <guibutton>Save</guibutton>.  The <command>ppad</command>
commands show above will then be generated and executed automatically.</para>

<title>Changes for the Macintosh Print Server</title>

<para>
The printer we are changing has an entry in <filename>/etc/ppr/papsrv.conf</filename>
that looks like this:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
[Seabury Room 305]
PPRname=sea305
</screen>

</para>

<para> Since this entry makes no mention of the make and model of the
printer, there is nothing to change, however, when <command>papsrv</command>
starts it reads the printer's configuration and reads its PPD file.  It uses
the information it takes from the PPD file to answer questions put to it by
the Macintosh client.  Theirfore, until you restart
<command>papsrv</command>, <application>LaserWriter 8</application>'s auto
setup feature will continue to select the PPD file for the old printer.
Also, if the font lists of the old and new printers differ, documents may
print incorrectly.  To prevent this sort of problem, kill
<command>papsrv</command> and restart it as described in section <xref
linkend="start-restart"/>. </para>

<title>Changes for LAN Manager X</title>

<para>
If you are using NCR's LAN Manager for Unix, you will want to change the
comment attached to the LAN Manager queue:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
# net share sea305 "HP 4M in Seabury 305"
# net print sea305 "HP 4M in Seabury 305"
</screen>

</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Changes for Samba</title>

<para>If you are using Samba, you should edit <filename>smb.conf</filename> and change the printer's
comment, unless you are also using <command>ppr2samba</command>, in which case you can
simply run <command>ppr2samba</command>.  If you are using the web interface, the <command>ppr2samba</command>
will be executed automatically when you press <guibutton>Save</guibutton>.</para>
