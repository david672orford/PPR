<title>Viewing the Queue</title>

<para>
You may see what jobs are in the queue and what is happening to them by
using the <command>ppop list</command> command:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
$ ppop list chipmunk
Queue ID        For                  Time    Pgs Status
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
chipmunk-2715   John Smith           11:53AM 007 printing on chipmunk
                                                 14%, page 1
</screen>

</para>

<para>
The above command only listed the jobs queued for a particular printer. In
order to show all jobs for all printers use this command:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
$ ppop list all
Queue ID        For                  Time    Pgs Status
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
chipmunk-2715   John Smith           11:53AM 007 printing on chipmunk
                                                 14%, page 1
rat-2716        Pamela Andrews       11:55AM 007 printing on rat
                                                 14%, page
</screen>

</para>

<para>Of course, you can also view the queue using the web interface.  To view the queue for a specific
printer or group of printers, click on the printers icon in the PPR Web Control Panel and choose <guimenuitem>
View Queue</guimenuitem>.  To see all jobs, click on the icon labeled "Show All Queues".  A sample queue listing
window is shown in figure <xref linkend="web-jobs"/>.</para>

<figure id="web-jobs">

	<screeninfo>Mozilla 1.4, Linux, PPR 1.52</screeninfo>
	<graphic fileref="web_jobs.png" format="png"/>
</screenshot>
</figure>

<para>Or you might choose the Perl/Tk interface.</para>

<figure id="perltk-queue">

<sect2 id="canceling-jobs">
<title>Canceling Jobs</title>

<para>If John Smith wants to delete his job should use this command:</para>

<para>

<screen>
$ ppop cancel chipmunk-2715
1 job was canceled.
</screen>

</para>

<para>He could have used another form of the command, a form which deletes
all jobs which he has queued for chipmunk:</para>

<para>

<screen>
$ ppop cancel chipmunk
1 job was canceled.
</screen>

</para>

<para>
Since on this occasion he had only one job, this command has the save effect
as the first one.
</para>

<para>If he were using the web interface, he could check the boxes next to the jobs he wishes the remove
and then press the <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton> at the bottom of the window.</para>
