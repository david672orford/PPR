<Para>
If John Smith wants to delete his job should use this command:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
$ ppop cancel chipmunk-2715
1 job was canceled.
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
He could have used another form of the command, a form which deletes all
jobs which he has queued for chipmunk:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
$ ppop cancel chipmunk
1 job was canceled.
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
Since on this occasion he had only one job, this command has the save effect
as the first one.
