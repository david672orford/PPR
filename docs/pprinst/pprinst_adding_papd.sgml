<title>Adding PPR Printers to the PPR AppleTalk Server</title>

<para>Sharing a printer with Macintosh clients over AppleTalk is simple.  Simply
use a command like this:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
# ppad addon myprn "My Printer"
</screen>
</para>

<para>To share a group, do this:</para>

<para>
<screen>
# ppad group addon ourgroup papname "Our Group"
</screen>
</para>

<para>If you can't see the new names in the chooser within a minute or so, make sure that
<command>papd</command> is running.  If it is, it may not be able to automatically detect
that the configuration has changed.  Try doing this:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
# /usr/lib/ppr/bin/papd --reload
</screen>
</para>

<para>If that doesn't do the trick, you may find clues in
<filename>/var/spool/ppr/logs/papd</filename>.  You can use this command to
display the end of it:</para>

<para>
<screen>
# /usr/lib/ppr/bin/papd --tail
</screen>
</para>

This will display the last few lines of the file and then wait, displaying new
lines as they are added.
