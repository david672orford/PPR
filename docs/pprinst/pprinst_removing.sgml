<title>Removing PPR</title>

<para>Removing <application>PPR</application> is not difficult but if you
aren't careful you may leave some of its hooks in the operating system.  In
this section we describe the commands needed to remove
<application>PPR</application> neatly.  These commands are similar to those
used in the RPM pacakage.  The commands you will use vary a bit from
operating system to operating system.  In this section we will present
typical commands.</para>

<para>First you should stop the spooler.  Any easy way to do this is to use
the Init script, like this:
<screen>
# /etc/init.d/ppr stop
</screen>
</para>

<para>Next you should remove <application>PPR</application>'s init scripts. 
These commands will work on most systems:
<screen>
# rm /etc/rc?.d/[SK][0-9][0-9]ppr
# rm /etc/init.d/ppr
</screen>
Of course, you may have to adjust them if your systems Init scripts are in
differnt places.
</para>

<para> and its Inetd or
Xinetd configuration.  For Xinetd, just delete the file, like this:
<screen>
# rm /etc/xinetd.d/ppr
</screen>
For Inetd you will have to edit <filename>/etc/inetd.conf</filename> to
remove the lines for the <application>PPR</application> web-browser
interface and lpr/lpd server.  Don't forget to send SIGHUP to Inetd or
Xinetd when you are done.  While you are at it, you might as well remove
your access rules from <filename>/etc/hosts.allow</filename>.
</para>

<para>Next you should unhook <application>PPR's</application> UPRINT system,
putting the real versions of commands such as <command>lpr</command> and
<command>lpq</command> back where they were:
<screen>
# /usr/lib/ppr/bin/uprint-newconf --remove
Restoring original spooler program names:

Files for lp should be in their normal locations.
Removing symbolic link "/usr/bin/lp".
Moving "/usr/bin/real-lp" back to "/usr/bin/lp".
Removing symbolic link "/usr/bin/cancel".
Moving "/usr/bin/real-cancel" back to "/usr/bin/cancel".
Removing symbolic link "/usr/bin/lpstat".
Moving "/usr/bin/real-lpstat" back to "/usr/bin/lpstat".

Files for lpr should be in their normal locations.
Removing symbolic link "/usr/bin/lpr".
Moving "/usr/bin/real-lpr" back to "/usr/bin/lpr".
Removing symbolic link "/usr/bin/lprm".
Moving "/usr/bin/real-lprm" back to "/usr/bin/lprm".
Removing symbolic link "/usr/bin/lpq".
Moving "/usr/bin/real-lpq" back to "/usr/bin/lpq".

Done.
</screen>
</para>

<para>Next you should remove <application>PPR's</application> crontab file:
<screen>
# crontab -u ppr -r
</screen>
</para>

<para>Next you can remove all of <application>PPR's</application> files
(including configuration files) with these commands:
<screen>
# rm -r /usr/lib/ppr
# rm -r /usr/share/ppr
# rm -r /var/spool/ppr
# rm -r /etc/ppr
</screen>
</para>

<para>Finally you should remove the users <literal>ppr</literal> and
<literal>pprwww</literal> and the group <literal>ppr</literal>.  Here are
the commands for Solaris or a typical Linux system:
<screen>
# /usr/sbin/userdel ppr
# /usr/sbin/userdel pprwww
# /usr/sbin/groupdel ppr
</screen>
</para>
