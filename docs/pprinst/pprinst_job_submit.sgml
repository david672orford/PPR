<title>Submitting Jobs to PPR</title>

<para>All jobs enter <application>PPR</application>'s queue through the
program <command>ppr</command>. The LANMAN/X print processor script invokes
<command>ppr</command> as do the Macintosh print server,
<command>papsrv</command>, <ulink
url="http://www.samba.org"><application>Samba</application></ulink> and the
LPR/LPD compatible server <command>lprsrv</command>.</para>

<para>Unix users invoke <command>ppr</command> (the program, not the spooler
system) directly. To make this easier, <filename class="SymLink">/usr/bin/ppr
</filename> is a symbolic link to
<filename>/usr/ppr/bin/ppr</filename>.  For a complete description of
<command>ppr</command>'s options, see the <ulink
url="../refman/ppr.1.html">ppr(1) man page</ulink>.  A description of some
of the more important ones follows.</para>

<sect2>
<title>Simple Examples</title>

<para>
When invoking <command>ppr</command>, the <option>-d</option> switch may be used to specify the
destination, that is, a printer or group of printers.  For example:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
$ ppr -d myprn report1.ps
</screen>

</para>

<para>
If <command>ppr</command> is invoked without specifying the name of a file to print,
it reads the file from stdin.  For example, we can print a document using PPR
on a remote system using this command:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
$ cat report1.ps | rsh cberry 'ppr -d hisprn'
</screen>

</para>

<para>The first thing <command>ppr</command> does is analyze the input file
to determine whether it is PostScript or not, and if not, what it is.  If it
is not PostScript, <command>ppr</command> will attempt to convert it to
PostScript before it is placed in the queue.  For example, ASCII text files
can be printed:</para>

<para>

<screen>
$ ls -l /usr/bin | ppr -d myprn
</screen>

</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Choosing Options</title>

<para>
When submitting a job, you may want to specify additional options.  These
options can do things such as select multiple copies, invoke printer features
such as duplex, or select paper trays.
</para>

<para>
When submitting the job from the Unix shell, you just add the options to the
<command>ppr</command> command line.  When the job arrives through a network server such
as Samba, <command>papsrv</command>, or <command>lprsrv</command> it is more difficult to select options.
</para>

<para>
The easiest thing to do in this latter case is to set a switchset.  A switchset
is a set of options associated with a queue.  This feature is described later in
this section.  The switchset method has the advantage that a switchset established
in this way applied
to all jobs no matter how they arrive.  This consistency can prevent confusion.
</para>

<para>
With some network servers there are additional ways to specify options which apply only
to jobs submitted through it.  These methods will be described later in this section.
</para>

<sect3>
<title>Duplex Options</title>

<para>
The available duplexing options are many and somewhat confusing.  Let us
start with a simple one:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
$ ppr -d myprn -F '*Duplex DuplexNoTumble' mydoc.ps
</screen>

</para>

<para> This instructs PPR to extract the code from the <literal>*Duplex
DuplexNoTumble</literal> line in the PPD file and insert it in the document
setup section of <filename>mydoc.ps</filename>.  Code inserted in this way
will override pre-existing duplex code in most cases. </para>

<para>
Suppose though that you wish to allow users to continue to select the duplex
mode, perhaps by using the Macintosh driver LaserWriter 8 with an appropriate
PPD file, but you wish to make duplex printing the default.  On some printers
you can use the front panel to select duplex, but PPR wouldn't know you had
done this, it would believe the printer was operating in simplex mode, thus
its printer accounting sheet counts would be thrown off.  Therefore, it would
be better to invoke <command>ppr</command> like this:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
$ ppr -d myprn -R duplex:duplex mydoc.ps
</screen>

</para>

<para> The option <option>-R duplex:duplex</option> instructs PPR to take
note of comments within the PostScript which indicate which duplex mode is
being invoked. The second occurence of the word <literal>duplex</literal>,
after the colon, means to invoke ordinary duplex mode if no such comments
are found. </para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Multiple Copy Options</title>

<para>
PPR is capable of printing multiple copies of a job. It is also capable of
printing collated copies.  The number of copies may be selected when <command>ppr</command> is
invoked:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
$ ppr -d myprn -n 3 mydoc.ps
</screen>

</para>

<para> This prints 3 copies of the file <filename>mydoc.ps</filename>.  By
default, PPR prints uncollated copies, that is, 3 copies of page 1, 3 copies
of page 2, etc.  In contrast, when printing collated copies, it prints 1
copy of page one, 1 copy of page 2, on to the end of the document and then
repeats until it has printed the required number of copies.  We can print
collated copies with this command: </para>

<para>

<screen>
$ ppr -d myprn -n 3 -n collate mydoc.ps
</screen>

</para>

<para>
When there is no charge for printing pages on a particular printer, if you do not
use an <option>-n</option> switch, PPR does not attempt to influence the number of copies to be
printed.  This means that if the document contains code to invoke multiple copy
features of the printer, PPR may not be able to correctly determine the number of
pages printed.  Thus, the number of sheets quoted on the banner page and in the
print log could be wrong.  This changes if you have specified an amount of money to
be charged for each page which is printed on the printer that is being used.  If
you have specified an amount, even $0.00, then the number of copies is
forced to 1 if you do not specify it.
</para>

<para> You may wish to allow the number of copies desired to be specified in
the document.  If you invoke <command>ppr</command> with the <option>-R
copies</option> option, PPR will read any
<literal>%%Requirement:</literal> comments which specify the
number of copies or collating mode and obey them.  You might use this
command: </para>

<para>

<screen>
$ ppr -d myprn -n 1 -n collate -R copies mydoc.ps
</screen>

</para>

<para>
This command tells PPR to read the copies count in
<filename>mydoc.ps</filename>, collate the
copies even if <filename>mydoc.ps</filename> does not request it, and to print 1 copy unless
<filename>mydoc.ps</filename> contains a comment which specifies a different number of copies.
However, if there is no charge for printing on this printer and the <option>-n
1</option>
switch were absent and <filename>mydoc.ps</filename> contained the PostScript code but not the
comments for multiple copies it would achieve multiple copies on the sly.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="switchsets">
<title>Using Option Switchsets
</title>

<para>
It is sometimes desirable to choose a set of options to be applied to all jobs
entering a certain queue.
</para>

<para>
To set these options, use the <command>ppad switchset</command> command for a printer
queue and the <command>ppad group switchset</command> command for a group queue.
</para>

<para>
For example, imagine that we have
a printer called <literal>mcec_1</literal>.  We want to create two queues for it called
<literal>mcec_sim</literal> and <literal>mcec_dup</literal>.  We want
<literal>mcec_sim</literal> to print in simplex
mode by default and <literal>mcec_dup</literal> to print in duplex mode by default.  First
we create the groups <literal>mcec_sim</literal> and <literal>mcec
dup</literal> each of which contains
the lone member <literal>mcec_1</literal>:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
# ppad group add mcec_sim mcec_1
# ppad group add mcec_dup mcec_1
</screen>

</para>

<para>
Now, jobs sent to either group will go to the same printer, but we will give
each group a different set of options:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
# ppad group switchset mcec_sim -R duplex:simplex
# ppad group switchset mcec_dup -R duplex:duplex
</screen>

</para>

<para> Now, when a job is submitted to <literal>mcec_sim</literal> or
<literal>mcec_dup</literal>, the the option <option>-R duplex:simplex</option> or
<option>-R duplex:duplex</option> to be inserted. </para>

<para>
A switchset may be deleted by setting it to nothing.  This command deletes
the switchset for the printer <literal>chipmunk</literal>:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
# ppad switchset chipmunk
</screen>

</para>

<sect3 id="optsformac">
<title>Options for Jobs from Macintoshs
</title>

<para> If we are printing from a Macintosh, the job will enter the print
server through <command>papsrv</command>.  If we wanted to make duplex
printing the default, we could place the <option>-R duplex:duplex</option>
option in the <filename>papsrv.conf</filename>. We could make an entry such
as this one: </para>

<para>

<screen>
[My Printer]
PPRname=myprn
PPRparms=-R duplex:duplex
</screen>

</para>

<para>
In like manner, if we wanted to make tumble duplexing the default, we could
create an entry like this one:
</para>

<para>

<screen>
[My Printer]
PPRname=myprn
PPRparms=-R duplex:duplextumble
</screen>

</para>

<para>
However, as noted earlier, it may be better to use a switchset since a switchset
will apply to all submission methods.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Options for Jobs Received through Samba</title>

<para>
Since Samba allows the administrator to choose any desired print command
when creating a queue in <filename>smb.conf</filename>, it is possible to give a queue
a special <command>ppr</command> command which includes the desired options.
</para>

<para>
However, this becomes clumsy if one is using <command>ppr2samba</command> to generate
a <filename>smb-include.conf</filename> file to include in
<filename>smb.conf</filename>, so this method
is not recomended.  Use a switchset instead.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Options for Jobs Received through <command>lprsrv</command></title>

<para>
There is no way to specify <command>ppr</command> command line options in any of the
<command>lprsrv</command> configuration files, so you must use switchsets to force the
use of options.
</para>

<para>
However, certain options, such as the number of copies, can be selected by the
client and passed to <command>lprsrv</command> using the RFC 1179 protocol.  Some operating
systems, such as OSF and SunOS/Solaris extend the protocol to allow for furthur
options.  When <command>lprsrv</command> receives these options it attempts to convert them
into appropriate <command>ppr</command> command line options.
</para>

</sect3>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Submitting Jobs Through Uprint</title>

<para> If you have Unix users, they are probably accustomed to submitting
jobs with <command>lpr</command> or <command>lp</command>.  You may also
find that while some of your applications allow you to specify the command
to be used for printing, others insist on using <command>lpr</command> or
<command>lp</command>.  In these cases, you might want to try
<application>PPR</application>'s <application>Uprint</application> system.
</para>

<para>
Uprint is a set of programs which mimic <command>lp</command>,
<command>lpr</command>, <command>lpq</command>,
and <command>lprm</command>.  You can rename the versions of these
programs that came with your system
and replace them with the <application>Uprint</application> substitutes.  When a
<application>Uprint</application> substitute
program is used, if the requested print queue is one that belongs to the
system spooler, the renamed origional program will be invoked.  If however
the requested queue is a PPR queue, an appropriate command for <command>ppr</command>
or <command>ppop</command> will be created and run.
</para>

<para>
For instructions for setting up Uprint, see the UPRINT(8) man page.
