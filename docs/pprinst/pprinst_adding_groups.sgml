<Title>Making Groups of Printers</Title>

<Para>
You may wish to form groups of printers.  A group is assigned a name and
member printers are specified.  Jobs may be submitted to the group and PPR will
decide which printer the job will be printed on. It is simplest if all the
member printers are of the the same make and model, but PPR can often smooth
over the differences, especially when using automatic bin selection and
reasonably good printer drivers such as LaserWriter 8.  A group is formed when
the first member is assigned.  Members are assigned to a group like this:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
# ppad group add ourgroup myprn
# ppad group add ourgroup yourprn
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
Members may be removed from groups like this:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
# ppad group remove ourgroup myprn
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
Removing all members from a group does not delete it. A group is deleted
like this:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
# ppad group delete ourgroup
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
Members may be added and removed even while jobs are being printed.  If a
printer is removed while it is printing a job for that group, it will finish
that job, but it will not print any more jobs for that group.  If a printer
is added, it will be used as soon as it is idle and there is a job which
needs a printer. If the group has no members, its jobs will not be printed
until members are added.
</Para>

<Para>
It is recomended that you set a group's comment
field.  The comment field is set in this manner:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
# ppad group comment ourgroup 'The printers we share'
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
Each group has a parameter called <Option>Rotate</Option>.  If
<Option>Rotate</Option> is
<Literal>false</Literal>, then when the time comes to print a job,
<Application>PPR</Application> uses the first idle
printer, starting with the first member of the group.  This will probably mean
that the printers at the begining of the group's members list will get used
more often.  If <Option>Rotate</Option> is set to <Literal>true</Literal>, PPR will try to use the
printers in round-robin fashion.  <Option>Rotate</Option> is
<Literal>true</Literal> by default, it may
be set to <Literal>false</Literal> with a command like this one:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
# ppad group rotate ourgroup false
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
The configuration of a group may be viewed with the <Command>ppad group
show</Command>
command, like this:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
# ppad group show ourgroup
Group name: ourgroup
Comment: A printer at random
Members: myprn, yourprn
Rotate: True
Default Filter Options:
Switchset:
</Screen>

</Para>
