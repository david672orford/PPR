<title>Starting and Restarting the PPR Spooler</title>

<para>
When you have finished running the spooler install script, you are ready
to start the spooler daemons for the first time.

<title>Manual Way</title>

<para>
You can start it manually with the following commands:
<screen>
# /usr/lib/ppr/bin/pprd
# /usr/lib/ppr/bin/papsrv
</screen>
The first command starts the spooler daemon, the second starts the server
for Macintosh clients. (Note that until you create a
configuration file for <command/papsrv/, it will only run long enough to
discover that the configuration file is missing.)
</para>

<para>
To shut them down, use these commands:
<screen>
# /usr/lib/ppr/bin/papsrv --stop
Sending SIGTERM to papsrv (PID=10163).
Waiting while papsrv shuts down....
Shutdown complete.
# /usr/lib/ppr/bin/pprd --stop
Sending SIGTERM to pprd (PID=25524).
Waiting while pprd shuts down....
Shutdown complete.
</screen>
</para>

<para>
You may of course use the <command>kill</command> command to kill the processes.
If you do though, remember that it is important to never kill <command/papsrv/ 
with the command <command/kill -9/ or <command/kill -KILL/ unless gentler means 
have already failed.
</para>

<para>
One reason this is important is because, depending on which AppleTalk implementation
you are using,
<command/papsrv/ may have to call shutdown code to remove the advertised names
from the AppleTalk network. If killed by SIGKILL, <command/papsrv/ will be
unable to call the shutdown code and the names will remain.  You might then
have to stop and restart the AppleTalk protocol stack to get rid of them. Until
you get rid of them, you will be unable to restart <command/papsrv/ and any
Macintosh clients which attempt to print to the now dead names will probably
crash.

<sect2><title>Automatic Way</title>

<para>
The above paragraphs describe how to start and stop the PPR daemons individually 
with simple Unix commands.  There are other, more automated ways to
do it. For example, if your system uses a System V style <command/init/, you
can stop all of the PPR daemons and once by finding the <filename/init.d/
directory (which is in different places in different operating systems) and
running the <command/ppr/ script which PPR installed there with the parameter
<command/stop/.  In the example below we have a RedHat Linux system and are
logged in as ``root''.  We start and then stop the PPR daemons:
<screen>
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/ppr start
Starting PPR daemons: pprd papsrv
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/ppr stop
Stopping PPR daemons: pprd papsrv
</screen>
