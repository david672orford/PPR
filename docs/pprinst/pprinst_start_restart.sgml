<title>Starting and Restarting the PPR Spooler</title>

<para>
When you have finished running the spooler install script, you are ready
to start the spooler daemons for the first time.
</para>

<title>Manual Way</title>

<para>
You can start it manually with the following commands:
<screen>
# /usr/lib/ppr/bin/pprd
# /usr/lib/ppr/bin/papsrv
</screen>
The first command starts the spooler daemon, the second starts the server
for Macintosh clients. (Note that until you create a
configuration file for <command>papsrv</command>, it will only run long enough to
discover that the configuration file is missing.)
</para>

<para>
To shut them down, use these commands:
<screen>
# /usr/lib/ppr/bin/papsrv --stop
Sending SIGTERM to papsrv (PID=10163).
Waiting while papsrv shuts down....
Shutdown complete.
# /usr/lib/ppr/bin/pprd --stop
Sending SIGTERM to pprd (PID=25524).
Waiting while pprd shuts down....
Shutdown complete.
</screen>
</para>

<para>
You may of course use the <command>kill</command> command to kill the processes.
If you do though, remember that it is important to never kill
<command>papsrv</command>
with the command <command>kill -9</command> or <command>kill -KILL</command> unless gentler means 
have already failed.
</para>

<para>One reason this is important is because, depending on which AppleTalk
implementation you are using, <command>papsrv</command> may have to call
shutdown code to remove the advertised names from the AppleTalk network. If
killed by SIGKILL, <command>papsrv</command> will be unable to call the
shutdown code and the names will remain.  You might then have to stop and
restart the AppleTalk protocol stack to get rid of them. Until you get rid
of them, you will be unable to restart <command>papsrv</command> and any
Macintosh clients which attempt to print to the now dead names will probably
crash.</para>

<sect2><title>The Automatic Way</title>

<para>The above paragraphs describe how to start and stop the PPR daemons
individually with simple Unix commands.  There are other, more automated
ways to do it. For example, if your system uses a System V style
<command>init</command>, you can stop all of the PPR daemons and once by
finding the <filename>init.d</filename> directory (which is in different
places in different operating systems) and running the
<command>ppr</command> script which PPR installed there with the parameter
<command>stop</command>.  The example below will work on most System V
derived and recent Linux systems.  Here we start and then stop the PPR daemons:

<screen>
# /etc/init.d/ppr start
Starting PPR daemons: pprd papsrv
# /etc/init.d/ppr stop
Stopping PPR daemons: pprd papsrv
</screen>
</para>
