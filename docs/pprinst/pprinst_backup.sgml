<Title>Backing Up PPR's Data</Title>

<Para>
PPR stores temporary data (print jobs, client printing transfer files and
such) in <Literal remap="tt">/var/spool/ppr</Literal>.  In <Literal remap="tt">/usr/ppr</Literal>, most of the
directories contain only static data.  The configuration is stored in the
directory tree starting at <Literal remap="tt">/etc/ppr</Literal>.  PPR continually adds files to
<Literal remap="tt">/var/spool/ppr/cache</Literal>, but these will be replaced automatically, so it
is not essential that they be backed up.  No files are added to
<Literal remap="tt">/usr/ppr/cache</Literal>.  PPR also writes into <Literal remap="tt">/var/spool/ppr/logs</Literal> and
<Literal remap="tt">/var/spool/ppr/printers/alerts</Literal> but these are throw away files.  The PPR
spooling system can be adequately rebuilt by installing PPR from scratch and then
restoring <Literal remap="tt">/etc/ppr</Literal>.
