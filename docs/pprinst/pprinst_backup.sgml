<Title>Backing Up PPR's Data</Title>

<Para><Application>PPR</Application> stores its configuration entirely in
<Filename class="Directory">/etc/ppr/</Filename>.  The PPR spooling system
can be adequately rebuilt by installing PPR from scratch and then restoring
<Filename class="Directory">/etc/ppr/</Filename>. </Para>

<Para>The directories 
<Filename class="Directory">/usr/lib/ppr/</Filename>, and <Filename
class="Directory">/usr/share/ppr/</Filename> 
contain only static data.</Para>

<Para>PPR stores temporary data (print jobs, client printing transfer files
and such) in <Filename class="Directory">/var/spool/ppr</Filename>. PPR
continually adds files to <Filename
class="Directory">/var/spool/ppr/cache</Filename>, but these will be
replaced automatically, so it is not essential that they be backed up.  No
files are added to <Filename
class="Directory">/usr/lib/ppr/cache</Filename>.  PPR also writes into
<Filename class="Directory">/var/spool/ppr/logs/</Filename> and the
subdirectories of <Filename
class="Directory">/var/spool/ppr/printers/</Filename> but these are throw
away files.  A possible exception is
<Filename>/var/spool/ppr/logs/printlog</Filename> which you will want to
back up if it is important to you.</Para>
