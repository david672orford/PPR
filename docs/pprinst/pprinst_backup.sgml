<title>Backing Up PPR's Data</title>

<para><application>PPR</application> stores its configuration entirely in
<filename class="Directory">/etc/ppr/</filename>.  The PPR spooling system
can be adequately rebuilt by installing PPR from scratch and then restoring
<filename class="Directory">/etc/ppr/</filename>. </para>

<para>The directories 
<filename class="Directory">/usr/lib/ppr/</filename>, and <filename
class="Directory">/usr/share/ppr/</filename> 
contain only static data.</para>

<para>PPR stores temporary data (print jobs, client printing transfer files
and such) in <filename class="Directory">/var/spool/ppr</filename>. PPR
continually adds files to <filename
class="Directory">/var/spool/ppr/cache</filename>, but these will be
replaced automatically, so it is not essential that they be backed up.  No
files are added to <filename
class="Directory">/usr/lib/ppr/cache</filename>.  PPR also writes into
<filename class="Directory">/var/spool/ppr/logs/</filename> and the
subdirectories of <filename
class="Directory">/var/spool/ppr/printers/</filename> but these are throw
away files.  A possible exception is
<filename>/var/spool/ppr/logs/printlog</filename> which you will want to
back up if it is important to you.</para>
