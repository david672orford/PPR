<title>PPR's User, Operator, and Administrator Interfaces</title>

<para>There are three principal ways of interacting with
<application>PPR</application>.  These are the command-line interface, the
web-browser interface, and the Perl/Tk interface.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>The Command Line Interface</title>

<para>The command-line interface is the most complete.  All of the other
interfaces use the command-line interface in the background.  The principal
commands are <command>ppr</command>, <command>ppop</command>, and
<command>ppad</command>.</para>

<para>The <command>ppr</command> command is used to submit print jobs.  It
works much like <command>lpr</command> or <command>lp</command>.
If a filename is specified on the command line, it is printed,
otherwise the data to be printed is ready from stdin.  The
<option>-d</option> is used to specify the queue to which to submit the
job.</para>

<para>The <command>ppop</command> command is the command which users and
operators use to control the spooler.  With it they can list the queue,
delete jobs, mount forms, and perform similiar tasks that don't alter the
spooler configuration.</para>

<para>The <command>ppad</command> command is the one which the system
administrator uses to alter the spooler's configuration.  Like the
<command>ppop</command> command, the <command>ppad</command> command is a
container for many subcommands.</para>

<para>This manual will provide many examples of the use of these commands.
Complete explanations of all of their options and subcommands can be found
in their man pages.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>The Web-Browse Interface</title>

<para>The web-browser interface is the second most complete.  It provides a
way to manage jobs and create, modify, and delete print queues.  It does not
provide a way to submit jobs other than test pages.  In a modern browser
such as <application>Mozilla</application>, the interface looks more like a
modern GUI than a typical web-browser interface. </para>

<para>One reaches the web-browser interface by connecting to port 15010 on
the print server.  This is illustrated in figure <xref linkend="web-start"/>
below.</para>

</figure>

<para>The first page which one sees provides links to a number of things
including <application>PPR</application> documentation and the PPR
web-browser interface.  The web browser interface is shown in figure
<xref linkend="web-control"/> below.</para>

</mediaobject>
</figure>

<para>Some of the operations which you can perform using the web interface require
authentication and authorization.  If you are running the web browser on a Linux
system and connecting to the same system using the address <literal>localhost</literal>,
then <application>PPR</application> will be able to determine which user is on
the other browser side of the connection.  Under any other circumstance, you will have to
present a username and password.</para>

<sect2>
<title>The Perl/Tk Interface</title>

<para>The Perl/Tk interface is the least mature.  It currently provides a
way to print files, view and manage queues, view printer status, and start
and stop printers.  It does not provide any way to alter the spooler
configuration.  There are also some gaps in the functions which it does
provide.
