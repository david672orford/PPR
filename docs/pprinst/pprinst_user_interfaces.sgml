<title>PPR's User, Operator, and Administrator Interfaces</title>

<para>There are three principal ways of interacting with
<application>PPR</application>.  These are the command-line interface, the
web-browser interface, and the Perl/Tk interface.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>The Command Line Interface</title>

<para>The command-line interface is the most complete.  All of the other
interfaces use the command-line interface in the background.  The principal
commands are <command>ppr</command>, <command>ppop</command>, and
<command>ppad</command>.</para>

<para>The <command>ppr</command> command is used to submit print jobs.  It
works much like <command>lpr</command> or <command>lp</command>. If a
filename is specified on the command line, it is printed, otherwise the data
to be printed is ready from stdin.  The <option>-d</option> is used to
specify the queue to which to submit the job.  Other options are available
to control such things as multiple copies, duplexing, and user notification
of the job's fate.</para>

<para>The <command>ppop</command> command is the command which users and
operators use to control the spooler.  All users can list queues delete,
move, hold, etc. their own jobs.  Users who have been granted operator's
rights can do the same to anyone's job.  They can also mount forms, start
and stop printers, and perform similiar tasks that don't alter the spooler
configuration.  A user can be granted operator access by adding his username
to <filename>/etc/ppr/acl/ppop.allow</filename>. </para>

<para>The <command>ppop</command> command is structured as a series of
subcommands.  For example, <command>ppop list</command> will list a queue
while <command>ppop cancel</command> will cancel a job.</para>

<para>The <command>ppad</command> command is the one which the system
administrator uses to alter the spooler's configuration.  Ordinary users 
can use it to view but not alter the spooler configuration.  Users who have
been granted spooler administrator access by adding their usernames to 
<filename>/etc/ppr/acl/ppad.allow</filename> can alter the spooler
configuration.  For example, they can add and delete printers.</para>

<para>Like the <command>ppop</command> command, the <command>ppad</command>
command is a container for many subcommands.  For example, <command>ppad
show</command> will display the configuration of a printer while
<command>ppad comment</command> will change its description.</para>

<para>This manual will provide many examples of the use of these commands.
Complete explanations of all of their options and subcommands can be found
in their man pages.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>The Web-Browse Interface</title>

<para>The web-browser interface is the second most complete.  It provides a
way to manage jobs and create, modify, and delete print queues.  It does not
provide a way to submit jobs other than test pages.  In a modern browser
such as <application>Mozilla</application>, the interface looks more like a
modern GUI than a typical web-browser interface. </para>

<para>One reaches the web-browser interface by connecting to port 15010 on
the print server.  This is illustrated in figure <xref linkend="web-start"/>
below.</para>

</screenshot>
</figure>

<para>The first page which one sees provides links to a number of things
including <application>PPR</application> documentation and the PPR
web-browser interface.  The web browser interface is shown in figure
<xref linkend="web-control"/> below.</para>

</figure>

<para>Some of the operations which you can perform using the web interface
require authentication and authorization.  If you are running the web
browser on a Linux system and connecting to the same system using the
address <literal>localhost</literal>, then <application>PPR</application>
will be able to determine which user is on the other browser side of the
connection.  Under any other circumstance, you will have to present a
username and password.</para>

<para>The PPR web-browser interface will not accept your system password. 
It could only do so if you were to send your password over the net where it
would be succeptible to eavesdropping.  Instead it uses what is known as
"digest" HTTP authentication.  In this sceme, your browser proves to the
server that you have told it your password by treating it as a number and
answering obscure questions about its mathmatical properties.  However, in
order to participate in this game, the server needs to have your password
encoded in a particular way.  The upshot is that you must use a special
password setting program to set the password for the PPR web-browser
interface.  Actually, the first time, a system administrator (root or
someone listed in <filename>/etc/ppr/acl/passwd.allow</filename> must do
this for you, like this:

<screen>
# ppr-passwd --add jjones
</screen>

</para>

<para>All authenticated users have the same level of access that they would
have at the command line.  This means that they can do things to their own
jobs, but everthing else, such as the spooler configuration, is read-only
for them.  A user can be granted a greater level of access by adding him to
the access control lists for the <command>ppop</command> and
<command>ppad</command> commands as described above.</para>

</sect2>

<title>The Perl/Tk Interface</title>

<para>The Perl/Tk interface is the least mature.  It currently provides a
way to print files, view and manage queues, view printer status, and start
and stop printers.  It does not provide any way to alter the spooler
configuration.  There are also some gaps in the functions which it does
provide.</para>
