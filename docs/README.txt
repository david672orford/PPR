Building the PPR documentation requires many packages.  For this reason, the
PPR source tarballs have pre-built documentation.  The required software
includes:

    Ghostscript
    Transfig
    Perl 5
    Xsltproc
    HTMLDOC
    DocBook XML DTD and entities (now included with PPR)
    DocBook XSL stylesheets
