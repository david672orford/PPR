ppr-lpq - Shows print jobs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<ppr-lpq> [B<-P> I<queue>] [B<-l>] [I<user>] [I<job number>] ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program is part of the PPR uprint suite.

This program is used to view print queues.  The B<-P> switch can be used
to specify the queue to be viewed.  If the B<-P> switch is not used then the
queue specified by the environment variable PRINTER is shown.  If the PRINTER
environment variable is not defined then the queue "default" is displayed
(assuming it exists).

If the B<-l> switch is used then a more verbose queue listing format is used.

If user names or job numbers appear on the command lines then only jobs
which are owned by one of those users or have one of the ids specified are
shown.
