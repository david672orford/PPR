=head1 NAME

B<ppr-panel> - open PPR's Perl-Tk control panel

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<ppr-panel> [B<-d> I<destname>] [I<filename>] ... ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command launches a GUI interface for PPR.  It is written in Perl with
the Tk widget set.  It has some overlap in function with the
web-browser-based GUI. Both can display queues, manage jobs, display printer
status, and control printers.  However the web interface has management
functions which the Tk GUI does not and the Tk GUI has a print dialog which
the web interface does not.

=head2 Control Panel

If no arguments are supplied, then the PPR control panel will be opened.

=head2 Queue Display

To skip the PPR control panel and open a queue display window, use B<-d>
I<destname>.  For example:

	$ ppr-web -d myprn

=head2 Job Submission

If non-option command line parameters are present, they are understood to be
the names of files to be printed on the indicated printer.  A print dialog
will be opened.  This dialog will allow the user to select a different
printer, select printer options, and select options provided by PPR such as
multiple copies.  If the I<-d> option is used, then the indicated queue will
be selected (though the user can still use the drop-down list to select a
different one).

=head2 Desktop Icons

If you are running a GUI such as KDE which provides desktop icons, this
command can be used as the the action command for an icon.  

If the icon is configured to run B<ppr-panel> without arguments, then if you
double click on the icon the control panel will open and if you drop files
on the icon a print dialog will open.

If the icon is configured to run B<ppr-panel> with the arguments B<-d>
I<queuename>, then double clicking on the icon will open the queue display
window and dropping files on the icon will open a print dialog with the 
indicated queue already selected.
