<sect1 id="pod2docbook-ch-1-sect-2"><title>DESCRIPTION

</title><para>
The shell script <emphasis>ppr-xfm</emphasis> and the <emphasis>ppr-xgrant</emphasis> program are designed to be used with the X-Windows file managers such as
Xfm.


</para>

<para>
To use <emphasis>ppr-xfm</emphasis> with Xfm, you should create one item in the Applications window for each
printer. The icon ``printer.xpm'' is a good one to use. The ``Push action''
should be ``exec /usr/ppr/bin/ppr-xfm <emphasis>destname</emphasis>''. The ``Drop action'' should be ``exec /usr/ppr/bin/ppr-xfm <emphasis>destname</emphasis> $*''.


</para>

<para>
If you drop files into the icon in the Applications window, they will be
printed. If you double click on the icon, a queue listing will be
presented.


</para>

<para>
When jobs are submitted through <emphasis>ppr-xfm</emphasis>, the responder ``xwin'' is used. The xwin responder will not work unless
the user ``ppr'' has permission to pop up windows on your X-Windows
display. In order to grant the permission, you should run the program
<emphasis>/usr/ppr/bin/xpprgrant</emphasis> at the start of your X session.


</para>

<para>
Some versions of Bash do not work with Xfm. If the files you drop into the
printer icon are not printed, install the shell Ash (included as
``/bin/sh'' in NetBSD and as ``/bin/ash'' in some Linux distributions) and
start Xfm with the command


</para>

<para>
<literal>SHELL=/bin/ash xfm &amp;</literal>




</para>

<para>
These scripts could be useful even when you are not using a file manager.
For instance, you could type the command:


</para>

<para>
<literal>/usr/ppr/bin/ppr-xfm myprinter somefile &amp;</literal>




</para>

<para>
to submit a file for printing. A window would pop up on your X display to
inform you when the job is done.
