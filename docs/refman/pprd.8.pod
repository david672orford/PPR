pprd - PostScript PRinter spooling Daemon

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<pprd> [B<--help>] [B<--version>] [B<--foreground>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command starts the PPR daemon.  It is a setuid program owned by "ppr".
The first thing this program does is check to see that the real user who
invoked it is "root" or "ppr".  If it is not, then B<pprd> exits immediately.

If the B<--help> or B<--version> switch is used it will print brief usage
information or PPR version information respectively.

The B<--foreground> switch tells B<pprd> not to puts itself in the background.  Use this switch if you
are running B<pprd> directly from B<init>.  Note that using this option does not cause debug and error 
messages to be sent to stdout.  They continue to go to F</var/spool/ppr/logs/pprd>.
