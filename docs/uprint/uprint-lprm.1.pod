uprint-lprm - Deletes print jobs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<uprint-lprm> [B<-P> I<queue>] [B<->] [B<job number>] [B<user>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program is part of the PPR Uprint suite.  See the UPRINT(1) man page
to learn about the Uprint suite.

The program B<uprint-lprm> is used to delete print jobs.  On your system,
the B<lprm> command may be an alias for B<uprint-lprm>.

There are several ways to indicate which queue one wants to remove a job from.
If the B<-P> switch is used, it overrides all other settings.  If the B<-P>
switch is not used, then B<uprint-lprm> falls back on the PRINTER environment
variable.  If the PRINTER environment variable is not defined, then it looks
for a "uprint-lpr=" setting in the "[default destinations]" section of
F<uprint.conf>.  If that too is not set, then B<uprint-lprm> assumes a queue
name of "lp".

There are three ways to specify which jobs within the selected queue should
be deleted.

If one or more job id numbers are specified, then the jobs with those id
numbers will be deleted.

If one or more user names are specified, then all jobs owned by those users
will be deleted.  Since ordinary users may not delete other people's jobs,
this option is only useful to the user "root".  (Note that PPR operators cannot
delete other people's jobs with B<uprint-lprm> as they can with B<ppop>.)

If the B<-> option is used, then all job belonging to the user who is running
B<lprm> are deleted.  If the user "root" is the one running B<lprm>, then all
jobs in the queue are deleted.

Note that if the remote server is running PPR's B<lprsrv>, then the definition
of "all jobs owned by this user" or "all jobs in the queue" may be limited
to those jobs submitted from the network node on which B<lprm> is being run.
However, the "proxy class=" setting in the F<lprsrv.conf> file can be used to
expand this scope at least somewhat.
