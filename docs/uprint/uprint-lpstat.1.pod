uprint-lpstat - Cancels print jobs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<uprint-lpstat>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program is part of the PPR.

This command attempts to emulate lpstat(1) from System V Unix.  Though it
recognizes most of lpstat(1)'s options, its implementation of some of them
is simplistic.  It is just adequate to satisfy GUI programs on Solaris.
