uprint-lpc - Controls printers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<uprint-lpc>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program is part of the PPR uprint suite.  See the UPRINT(1) man page
for an explanation of what this means.

Currently, only the B<status> subcommand is implemented.  It displays
just enough information to satisfy programs which use B<lpc status> to
fetch a list of available queues.
