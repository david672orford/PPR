The PPR source directory "misc/" contains a number of small programs and other
files.  Some of these are not described in the primary documentation.  Some
are not installed automatically.  Many of them are of questionable value.


======================
 ppd2macosdrv.perl
======================

This program converts the PPD files to MacOS format and installs them in
$VAR_SPOOL_PPR/drivers/macos.  Presumably, the system administrator will
then arrange to share that directory with CAP or Netatalk.


======================
 ppr-sync.sh
======================

This shell script can be used to syncronize the printer configurations on
two computers running PPR.  After making a change on one computer, while
logged in as "ppr", run "ppr-sync <othercomputer>".  This script uses rsh to
transfer the files.  It is really just a hack and not a very good one at that.


========================
 xmessage.tcl
========================

This is a Tcl/Tk wish script which is intended as a substitute for xmessage.

The program xmessage is part of some X distributions.  It is a simple utility
which is handy for popuping up simple dialog boxes from shell scripts.
Sadly, many X-Windows distributions don't include this neat little program.
This is not a perfect clone, but it is close enough to work for PPR.

This program is installed in $HOMEDIR/lib/.  The xwin responder and xwin
commentator will use it if xmessage is not found and wish is.


=========================
 printer_list.perl
=========================

This script prints a neat list of all the printers.  It is only intended as an
example which you can adapt to your needs, so it is not installed by
"make install".


=========================
 manual_duplex.sh
=========================

A shell script to submit a job twice in order to print it on both sides on a
simplex-only printer.  The user must removed the sheets after the first job
and re-insert them in the manual feed tray.  This script is only an example
and not a polished utility, so it is not installed by "make install".


=========================
 sgi_glp_hack.perl
=========================

If you run this script (as root), it will create dummy files in
/var/spool/lp, one for each PPR printer and each printer listed in
/etc/ppr/uprint-remote.conf.  You might want to do this so that SGI
programs such as glp (a graphical front-end for lp) will work correctly.
If you don't do this, their browse lists of print queues will be empty.

If the operating system is IRIX, then this script will be installed in
$HOMEDIR/bin/.


=========================
 custom_hook_docutech.perl
=========================

This script is for use with a Xerox Docutech 135 in Trinity College's print
shop.  Use it as an example.  It is installed in $HOMEDIR/lib/.


=========================
 ppr-wp-1.12.zip
=========================

This file contains WordPerfect 5.1 PostScript drivers for the HP LaserJet 4M
and a generic PostScript level 1 printer which work much better with PPR than
the ones supplied by WordPerfect Corp.
