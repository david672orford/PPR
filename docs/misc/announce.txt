==========================================================================

Version 1.52 of PPR has been released.

PPR is a Unix print spooler expressly designed for operating PostScript
printers.  It was written by David Chappell at the Trinity College Computing
Center in Hartford, Connecticut, U.S.A.

==========================================================================
 New in this Release (Since 1.51)
==========================================================================

* Fixed numberous build and install problems, especially problems affecting
  non-Linux systems.

* Fixed the web-browser interface's popup menu in IE 6.

* Cosmetic fixes to web interface for greater consistency between Mozilla
  1.4 and IE 6.

* Fixed problem editing switchsets in the web-browser interface.

* Fixed command output spacing problems caused by the source code tab-width
  conversion done in version 1.51.

* Added code to the install to send SIGHUP to Inetd or Xinetd so that it
  will load its new configuration.

* Partial rewrite of "Installing and Using PPR" to include information about
  the web-browser and Perl/Tk interfaces.

==========================================================================
 New in this Release (Since 1.50)
==========================================================================

* Reduced use of setUID programs, especially of setUID root programs.

* Reimplemented ppr-passwd so it no longer depends on Apache's htpasswd.

* Simplified the build process, eliminating the "fixup" step.

* Fixed bug which prevented the printing of banner pages for jobs without 
  job log files.

* Added code so that the Manualfeedtimeout and JobTimeout values set with
  "ppad userparams" take effect on level 2 PostScript printers too. 

* Added ppr-index command as the front end for index generation.  The separate
  commands, such as ppr-indexfonts, and ppr-indexppds have become backend 
  programs that are run by ppr-index.

* Added support for a "meta responder".  When using a meta responder, the
  user uses the ppr-followme command to register a responder method and
  address which can be used to contact him.  The ppr-followme command can be
  used to change this registration at any time.  This greatly simplifies
  things for X-Windows users since they no longer have to set environment
  variables such as PPR_RESPONDER in their windowing systme startup scripts.
  All they need to do is run ppr-responder and since the meta responder is
  the default, their print job message will get to them.  See the
  ppr-followme(1) manpage and the -m switch section in the ppr(1) manpage for
  details.

* Made the new Configure script the default one.  The old one is still
  available as Configure_old.

* Added support for gzip compressed PPD files.

* Improved ppr-panel (a Perl/Tk interface to PPR).  These improvements
  include the addition of a print dialog so that it can be used as a drag-
  and-drop target for printing files in desktop environments such as KDE.

* Converted the tab stops in the source code from every 8 columns to every
  4 columns.

* Added "socketapi", "appsocket", and "jetdirect" as aliases for the tcpip
  interface.  Some of them have different default options.

* Added "pros" interface for Axis print servers (this may still need
  debugging).

* Changed human-readable "ppad show" output to better group things by
  category and to indent second and subsequent lines of logical groups.

* More web interface fixes to suppress spurious Perl 5.8.0 warnings.

* Corrected sorting of AppleTalk names in the added printer wizard.

* Refined the reporting of printer status by "ppad status", especially for
  status derived from PJL USTATUS messages.


==========================================================================
 Major Features
==========================================================================

* Operates PostScript printers connected to parallel and serial ports,
  AppleTalk, LAN Manager X clients, LPD servers, and RAW TCP/IP adapters
  such as Extended Systems PocketPrintServers.

* If the interface to the printer supports it, captures messages returned by
  the printer while a job is printing.  If PostScript error messages are
  received, the job is placed in a special hold state for later examination.

* Sends notices to users when jobs are completed or when jobs fail due to
  PostScript errors or other problems.  (This is not supported on all client
  platforms.)

* Detects printer faults and attempts to clear them automatically.  If this
  fails, an operator can be informed.

* Interprets Document Structuring Convention comments in order to support
  advanced features including printer redirection, reverse order printing,
  collated copies, font downloading, font substitution, and forced duplex
  mode.

* Can pass print jobs through GhostScript before sending them to the printer
  in order to print PostScript files on non-PostScript printers.

* Automatically detects non-PostScript input and passes it through
  appropriate filters.

* One of the above mentioned filters is a line printer emulator which first
  measures the file in order to select proper margins, point size, 
  orientation, and line spacing.  It also supports overstrike bold and 
  underlining.  The line printer emulator supports many character sets 
  including ASCII, Macintosh, ISO Latin 1, and KOI8-R.

* An Epson compatible dot matrix printer emulator is also provided.  It
  converts files containing escape codes for Epson and IBM Proprinter
  compatible dot matrix printers and converts them to PostScript.

* When PPR is installed, it searches for certain other programs such as
  NetPBM, TeX, Groff, and the Adobe Acrobat Reader.  If these are found,
  PPR arranges to use them as filters to automatically convert JPEG,
  BMP, GIF, LaTeX and other files to PostScript.

* Automatically detects files compressed with Unix Compress or Gzip and
  uncompresses them before printing.

* Advertises printer queues on an AppleTalk network so that Macintosh
  computers can print to them even if the printers don't support AppleTalk.

* Accepts jobs from AT&T's LAN Manager for Unix and sends notices using the
  LAN Manager messaging facilities.

* Accepts jobs from the Samba LAN Manager compatible server and sends
  notices using Samba's messaging facilities.

* When used with Samba version 1.9.18 or later, PPR supports Windows 95
  drag-and-drop printer driver installation.  With Samba 2.2.x it supports
  Windows NT drag-and-drop too.

* Accepts jobs from other computers using the LPD protocol.

* While printing, the percentage of the job which has been sent is displayed
  in the queue listing, together with the page the spooler is transmitting,
  and, when the printer supportes it, the number of pages which have been
  printed.

* The status of a printer that is printing can be viewed.  This includes 
  conditions such as out-of-paper and low-toner.

* Prints jobs N-Up or generates signatures and booklets using Donald
  Markuson's N-Up dictionary.

* Keeps track of printer usage by means of user accounts from which money is
  deducted for each page printed on designated printers.  (Client support
  for this is still limited.)  PPR also has the ability to log all jobs so
  that reports can be run or bills can be sent to users.

* Allows a form to be "mounted" on each of a printer's input bins.  When a
  print job arrives, PPR will attempt to determine what kind of paper it
  should be printed on and select the correct bin.  If the correct form
  is not mounted, the job will be held until an operator mounts it.

* Prints banner pages which include information gleened from the Document
  Structure Comments, such as user name, number of pages, and warnings
  concerning defective DSC comments.

* Caches fonts received from Macintosh clients so that they need not be
  downloaded again.  This saves time the next time the document is printed.
  (This only works with LaserWriter 8.x.)

* If MS-Windows format TrueType fonts are manually installed in the spooler,
  it will convert them to PostScript and download them on demand.

* Provides programs which can be used as substitutes for lp, lpr, lpq,
  and lprm.  These programs will determine whether the queue selected
  belongs to PPR, to the standard system spooling system, or to a remote
  system listed in a special configuration file.  If the queue belongs
  to the standard system spooler then the standard program will be invoked.


=============================================================================
 Compatible Systems
=============================================================================

PPR was origionally written to work on AT&T's 6386 WGS and StarServer E
running Unix System V Release 4.0 and AT&T's port of LAN Manager to Unix
with AT&T's AppleTalk Network Program.

It was later ported to SunOS 5.x (Solaris 2.x) and CAP60 patch level 194.
Netatalk is not yet supported on Solaris 2.x.

Linux is currently the principal development system.  An extra library
called NATALI can be obtained from the place you got PPR.  This library
allows PPR to work with Netatalk under Linux.

DEC OSF/1 and Digital Unix 4.0 are also supported, though AppleTalk has not
been attempted.

SGI's IRIX 6.3 is also a supported platform.  However, AppleTalk on IRIX has
not been attempted.

The complete system has not been tested on 386BSD/NetBSD/FreeBSD/OpenBSD,
however it should run with only minor modifications.

Support for SunOS 4.1.3 is included in the current release but nobody has
reported whether or not it works.

The Cygnus Windows NT port can be compiled but it doesn't work yet.

The MacOS port can be compiled and installed, but the install scripts may
still need a little tweaking.  Final testing couldn't be accomplished
due to the limitations of the Sourceforge.net compile farm.

============================================================================
 Intended Audiance
============================================================================

PPR begain as a research project designed to explore the possibilities of
the Adobe Document Structuring convention, PPD files, and automatic
filtering.  The goal is to make printing easy for end users.

However, PostScript can be very complex and PPR is a very complex piece of
code.  Considerable effort has been expended to make PPR easy to set up and
use.  All the same, some level of understanding of PostScript, the Document
Structuring Convention, and the processes involved is sometimes required.

While PPR has been used with a number of PostScript generating applications,
it has not been possible to test it with every one.  This problem should be
a matter of moderate concern because most if not all PostScript generating
applications have one or more errors in their conformance to the Document
Structuring Convention.  When document structuring comments make serious
factual errors in their description of the structure of the document or
concerning the fonts and other resources required, PPR may fail to print it
even though a more simple minded spooler would print it.

When unexpected results are obtained, it may be necessary to examine the
input and the output, manually interpreting the DSC comments.  Anyone
supporting PPR would be well advised to first read Appendix G of "PostScript
Language Reference Manual, Second Edition" as well as "PostScript Printer
Description File Format Specification".

That said, it should be noted that PPR has been extensively tested in an
environment containing hundreds of clients and dozens of printers.  The
clients have included Unix, MS-DOS, MS-Windows, and MacOS.


============================================================================
 Technical Support
============================================================================

Trinity College cannot of course guarantee to provide you with technical
support for this for this product.  As stated above, while PPR is intended
to make printing easy to set up and use, diagnosing problems with PostScript
printing still requires specialized knowledge.

An installation manual, an incomplete technical description, and man pages
for most of the programs are provided.  We will also endeavor to participate
in the answering of questions sent to the PPR mailing list.  We regret that
Trinity College is not in a position to provide technical support beyond
this.

Bug reports and suggestions are of course welcome.  Bug reports will be
most useful they describe the exact steps necessary to reproduce the
problem.  Of course, if you can if include a fix or point out the
offending source file and function, please do so.

Bug reports should be sent to <ppr-bugs@mail.trincoll.edu>.

If you have PostScript questions, it might be well to post them to the
Usenet news group "comp.languages.postscript".  Questions related to
CAP should be posted to "comp.protocols.appletalk".  Questions directly
related to PPR should be sent to the PPR mailing list.
