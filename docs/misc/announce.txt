==========================================================================

Version 2.00a1 of PPR has been released.

PPR is a Unix print spooler expressly designed for operating PostScript
printers.  It was written by David Chappell at the Trinity College Computing
Center in Hartford, Connecticut, U.S.A.

==========================================================================
 New in version 2.00a1
==========================================================================

* Greatly improved IPP support

* Dropped uprint-lpr, uprint-lp, etc.


==========================================================================
 Major Features
==========================================================================

* Operates PostScript printers connected to parallel and serial ports,
  AppleTalk, LAN Manager X clients, LPD servers, and RAW TCP/IP adapters
  such as Extended Systems PocketPrintServers.

* If the interface to the printer supports it, captures messages returned by
  the printer while a job is printing.  If PostScript error messages are
  received, the job is placed in a special hold state for later examination.

* Sends notices to users when jobs are completed or when jobs fail due to
  PostScript errors or other problems.  (This is not supported on all client
  platforms.)

* Detects printer faults and attempts to clear them automatically.  If this
  fails, an operator can be informed.

* Interprets Document Structuring Convention comments in order to support
  advanced features including printer redirection, reverse order printing,
  collated copies, font downloading, font substitution, and forced duplex
  mode.

* Can pass print jobs through GhostScript before sending them to the printer
  in order to print PostScript files on non-PostScript printers.

* Automatically detects non-PostScript input and passes it through
  appropriate filters.

* One of the above mentioned filters is a line printer emulator which first
  measures the file in order to select proper margins, point size, 
  orientation, and line spacing.  It also supports overstrike bold and 
  underlining.  The line printer emulator supports many character sets 
  including ASCII, Macintosh, ISO Latin 1, and KOI8-R.

* An Epson compatible dot matrix printer emulator is also provided.  It
  converts files containing escape codes for Epson and IBM Proprinter
  compatible dot matrix printers and converts them to PostScript.

* When PPR is installed, it searches for certain other programs such as
  NetPBM, TeX, Groff, and the Adobe Acrobat Reader.  If these are found,
  PPR arranges to use them as filters to automatically convert JPEG,
  BMP, GIF, LaTeX and other files to PostScript.

* Automatically detects files compressed with Unix Compress or Gzip and
  uncompresses them before printing.

* Advertises printer queues on an AppleTalk network so that Macintosh
  computers can print to them even if the printers don't support AppleTalk.

* Accepts jobs from Samba and sends notices using Samba's messaging facilities.

* When used with Samba version 1.9.18 or later, PPR supports Windows 95
  drag-and-drop printer driver installation.  With Samba 2.2.x it supports
  Windows NT drag-and-drop too.

* Accepts jobs from other computers using the LPD protocol.

* While printing, the percentage of the job which has been sent is displayed
  in the queue listing, together with the page the spooler is transmitting,
  and, when the printer supportes it, the number of pages which have been
  printed.

* The status of a printer that is printing can be viewed.  This includes 
  conditions such as out-of-paper and low-toner.

* Prints jobs N-Up or generates signatures and booklets using Donald
  Markuson's N-Up dictionary.

* Keeps track of printer usage by means of user accounts from which money is
  deducted for each page printed on designated printers.  (Client support
  for this is still limited.)  PPR also has the ability to log all jobs so
  that reports can be run or bills can be sent to users.

* Allows a form to be "mounted" on each of a printer's input bins.  When a
  print job arrives, PPR will attempt to determine what kind of paper it
  should be printed on and select the correct bin.  If the correct form
  is not mounted, the job will be held until an operator mounts it.

* Prints banner pages which include information gleened from the Document
  Structure Comments, such as user name, number of pages, and warnings
  concerning defective DSC comments.

* If MS-Windows format TrueType fonts are manually installed in the spooler,
  it will convert them to PostScript and download them on demand.

* Provides programs which can be used as substitutes for lp, lpr, lpq,
  and lprm.  These programs will determine whether the queue selected
  belongs to PPR, to the standard system spooling system, or to a remote
  system listed in a special configuration file.  If the queue belongs
  to the standard system spooler then the standard program will be invoked.


=============================================================================
 Compatible Systems
=============================================================================

PPR was origionally written to work on AT&T's 6386 WGS and StarServer E
running Unix System V Release 4.0 and AT&T's port of LAN Manager to Unix
with AT&T's AppleTalk Network Program.

It was later ported to SunOS 5.x (Solaris 2.x) and CAP60 patch level 194.
Netatalk is not yet supported on Solaris 2.x.

Linux is currently the principal development system.  An extra library
called NATALI can be obtained from the place you got PPR.  This library
allows PPR to work with Netatalk under Linux.

DEC OSF/1 and Digital Unix 4.0 are also supported, though AppleTalk has not
been attempted.

SGI's IRIX 6.3 is also a supported platform.  However, AppleTalk on IRIX has
not been attempted.

The complete system has not been tested on 386BSD/NetBSD/FreeBSD/OpenBSD,
however it should run with only minor modifications.

Support for SunOS 4.1.3 is included in the current release but nobody has
reported whether or not it works.

The Cygnus Windows NT port can be compiled but it doesn't work yet.

The MacOS port can be compiled and installed, but the install scripts may
still need a little tweaking.  Final testing couldn't be accomplished
due to the limitations of the Sourceforge.net compile farm.
