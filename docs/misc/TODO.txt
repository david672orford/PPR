==============================================================================

* Decide how pprd should handle the matter of the hostname changing due 
  to dial-up networking.

* Finish ppr-papd (a replacement for papsrv).

* Evaluate libieee1284 at http://sourceforge.net/projects/libieee1284/.

* Add queue aliases support to ppr2samba.

* Add support for Samba's new MS-Windows driver download to ppr2samba.

* IPP support in UPRINT so that jobs can be sent to CUPS queues.  This
  should probably be done with libcups which is LGPL.  

* Make uprint-cancel and uprint-lpstat actually do something

* Write uprint-lpc, uprint-lpadmin, uprint-accept, and uprint-reject

* Change responder interface to use name=value pairs on the command line. 

* Change commentators to support the new status handling code and merge them
  with responders.

* Increase any limit on the length of the printer interface options line.

* Write an IPP server.

* Implement -F switch sorting in pprdrv.

* Replace the PPD parsing code in pprdrv and implement installable options
  handling.

* Implement PPR node-to-node printing, queue display, and job canceling.

* Add --dsc-charset to ppr.

* Add code to convert command line options to utf-8 and provide mechanism for 
  their translation.

* Support banner page "news" messages.

* Convert build to autoconf (maybe).
