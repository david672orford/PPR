<sect1><title>Introduction</title>

<para>This document is a collection of notes about the lpr/lpd printing
protocol described in RFC 1179.  RFC 1179 is not an Internet standard,
rather was an attempt to describe current practice.  As a result it does not
contain as rigourous a description of the protocol as a true Internet
standard would.  This document provides information not included in RFC 1179
or which is not clearly explained there.  It also provides information about
vendor extensions to the RFC 1179 protocol.</para>

<sect1><title>Who's Job?</title>

<para>
The queue files lines that begin with ``H'' and ``P'' are present in every
job.  They identify the node from which the job is printed and the name by which
the user is known on that node.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1><title>Banner Page</title>

<para>
If the user wants a banner page, then the ``J'', ``C'', and ``L'' lines will
be present.  BSD lpr ommits these lines when the user uses the
<emphasis remap="bf">lpr -h</emphasis> option.
</para>

<para>
The ``J'' line indicates the name of the job for the banner page and the
lpq listing.  This is norally composed of a list of the names of the files
printed, but the user may override this by using the <emphasis remap="bf">lpr -J</emphasis>
switch.  The ``C'' normally is the name of the node from which the job was
sent, but the user may substitute an arbitrary string by using the <emphasis remap="bf">lpr -C</emphasis>
switch.  The ``L'' line is the name of the user.  The value is appearently
redundant.  (It is the same as the value for ``P''.)
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1><title>Text File Processing</title>

<para>
If the <emphasis remap="bf">lpr -p</emphasis> switch was used then a ``T'' line will be included.  This gives
the title for <emphasis remap="bf">pr</emphasis> to print at the top of each page.
</para>

<para>
The width of the page will be indicated by a ``W'' line.
</para>

<para>
The left hand indent will be indicated by a ``I'' line.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1><title>Notification</title>

<para>
If the user should be notified by email when the job is done, then
there will be a ``M'' line.  In jobs from BSD lpr, the paramter will
be the same as the one in the ``P'' line.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1><title>OSF Extensions</title>

<para>
OSF/1 may include additional queue file lines.  They are as follows:

<variablelist>

<varlistentry><term>&lt; -- input tray</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This line is generated when the <emphasis remap="bf">lpr -I</emphasis> switch is used.  No restrictions are placed
on the argument to the <emphasis remap="bf">-I</emphasis> switch.  The <emphasis remap="bf">lpr</emphasis> man page mentions a number of likely
bin names including "upper", "lower", "cassette", "envelope_feeder", and "manual".
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>&gt; -- output tray</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This line is generated when the <emphasis remap="bf">lpr -o</emphasis> switch is used.  No restrictions
are placed on the arguments which may be used with the <emphasis remap="bf">-o</emphasis> switch, however the
<emphasis remap="bf">lpr</emphasis> man page says it will be an integer value.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>O -- orientation</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This line is generated when the <emphasis remap="bf">lpr -O</emphasis> switch is used.  According to the
<emphasis remap="bf">lpr</emphasis> man page, the value may be either "portrait" or "landscape", however
no restriction is actually placed on the value.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>K -- duplex</term>
<listitem>

<para> This line is generated whenever the <emphasis remap="bf">lpr
-K</emphasis> switch is used.  Though the <emphasis remap="bf">-K</emphasis>
switch accepts a number of alias values, the only values which will appear
in the queue file are "one", "two", "tumble", "one_sided_duplex",
"one_sided_tumble", and "two_sided_simplex".  (The last three print in the
mode described by the left hand part of the name but retain the layout
appropriate for the right hand part.) </para>

</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>G -- N-Up</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This line is used when the <emphasis remap="bf">lpr -N</emphasis> switch is used.  The value must be an integer
between 0 and 100 inclusive.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

</variablelist>

</para>

</sect1>

<sect1><title>Solaris Extensions</title>

<para>
Solaris systems (at least since version 2.6) may include additional queue file
lines.  They include the following:

<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term>5f -- form required (lp -f switch)</term>
<listitem>
<para>Description missing.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>5H -- special handling (lp -H switch)</term>
<listitem>
<para>Description missing.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>O -- lp -o options</term>
<listitem>
<para>Description missing.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>5P -- page list (lp -P switch)</term>
<listitem>
<para>Description missing.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>5S -- character set (lp -S switch)</term>
<listitem>
<para>Description missing.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>5T -- System V content type (lp -T switch)</term>
<listitem>
<para>Description missing.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>5y -- "Modes" (lp -y switch)</term>
<listitem>
<para>Description missing.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

</variablelist>

</para>

</sect1>

<sect1><title>The Files</title>

<para>
Each file is indicated by a line which has a lower case letter as a type code
at its begining and has the name of the queue data file as the rest of the line.
If the file is to be printed multiple times then this line is repeated the
required number of times.
</para>

<para>
After that comes an ``N'' line which indicates what name the file origionally had.
</para>

<para>
Finally, there is a ``U'' line which repeates the name of the file.
</para>
