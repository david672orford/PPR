<h1>Using Tcl/Tk and Itcl/Itk/Iwidgets for Cross Platform Programming</h1>

<p>The PPR component known as PPR Popup is a small application which runs on 
client PCs.  It is used in a computing lab environment.  In such an environment
people will sit down at a computer and try to print.  There is generally no 
login procedure for the computer, so if a password is required for printing,
PPR Popup can be used to prompt for it.

<p>Of course, computing labs run many different operating systems.  By using 
Tcl/Tk and Itcl/Itk/Iwidgets, it was possible to write an application that
runs under Win32, MacOS, and X Windows with little change.

<p>Unfortunately, there are gaps in the documentation which explains how to 
install and use Tcl and friends on some of these platforms.  These gaps
slowed down the PPR Popup project considerably.  This document attempts
to present the hard-to-find information gained during the PPR Popup project.

<h2>Tcl Distributions</h2>

<p>The first difficulty was in identifying usable distributions of Tcl for 
each of the three above-named platforms.

<h3>X-Windows</h3>

<p>X-Windows was easy, probably because Tcl/Tk and friends were developed on
that platform.

<h3>MacOS</h3>

<p>We had considerable difficulty finding a set of binary distributions for MacOS
which worked together and were sufficiently stable.  The necessary files were eventually
located on Sourceforge.

<h3>Win32</h3>

<p>For Win32 we used the excelent binary Tcl distribution from Activestate.
