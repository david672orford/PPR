<h1>Using Tcl/Tk and Itcl/Itk/Iwidgets for Cross Platform Programming</h1>

<p>The PPR component known as PPR Popup is a small application which runs on 
client PCs.  It is used in a computing lab environment.  In such an environment
people will sit down at a computer and try to print.  There is generally no 
login procedure for the computer, so if a password is required for printing,
PPR Popup can be used to prompt for it.

<p>Of course, computing labs run many different operating systems.  By using 
Tcl/Tk and Itcl/Itk/Iwidgets, it was possible to write an application that
runs under Win32, MacOS, and X Windows with little change.

<p>Unfortunately, there are gaps in the documentation which explains how to 
install and use Tcl and friends on some of these platforms.  These gaps
slowed down the PPR Popup project considerably.  This document attempts
to present the hard-to-find information gained during the PPR Popup project.

<h2>Tcl Distributions</h2>

<p>The first difficulty was in identifying usable distributions of Tcl for 
each of the three above-named platforms.

<p>The Tcl web sites appear to be in the midst of a shakup.  Tcl has
traditionally been available from <a
href="http://www.scriptics.com/">http://www.scriptics.com/</a>.  This site
appears to have been taken over by <a
href="http://www.activestate.com/">Activestate</a>).  It is being kept up to
date and current versions of Tcl and some related packages are available for
download.  But it the CVS repository is on <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge.net</a>.  Sourceforge also has
packages available for download that don't appear on the Scriptics pages.
Many of these packages are on the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/tcl/">Tcl</a> project page, but others are on
their own project pages and can be easily found through the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/foundry/tcl-foundry/>Tcl Foundry</a> page. </p>

<h3>X-Windows</h3>

<p>X-Windows was easy, probably because Tcl/Tk and friends were developed on
that platform.  That is not so say there were no problems.  One problem was
that Mandrake 8.1 has defective Itcl and Itk packages.  We downloaded the
Tcl/Tk source from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcl/">Tcl</a> project page</a>
and Itcl and friends from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/incrtcl/>
ITcl</a> project page, both at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge.net</a>.

<p>The first step is to unpack, build, and install Tcl:</p>

<pre>
$ tar zxvf tcl8.3.3.tar.gz
$ cd tcl8.3.3/unix
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
$ make
$ su
# make install
# exit
$ cd ../..
</pre>

<p>Then, Tk:</p>

<pre>
$ tar zxvf tk8.3.3.tar.gz
$ cd tk8.3.3/unix
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
$ make
$ su
# make install
# exit
$ cd ../..
</pre>

<p>The, Itcl/Itk:</p>

<pre>
$ tar zxvf itcl3.2.1_src.tgz
$ cd itcl3.2.1
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
$ make
$ su
# make install
# exit
$ cd ..
</pre>

<p>Installing Iwidgets is a little weird, you have to do it inside the Itcl build directory:</p>

<pre>
$ cd itcl3.2.1
$ tar zxvf ../iwidgets4.0.0.tar.gz
$ cd iwidgets4.0.0
$ ./configure
$ su
# make install
# exit
$ cd ../..
</pre>

<h3>MacOS</h3>

<p>We had considerable difficulty finding a set of binary distributions for MacOS
which worked together and were sufficiently stable.  The necessary files were eventually
located on Sourceforge.</p>

<p>Tcl and Tk can be downloaded from the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcl/">Tcl Project Page</a>.  There is
a <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/tcl/TclTk_8.3.4_FullInstall.bin">
binary distribution of Tcl/Tk 8.3.4</a> which seems reasonably stable.</p>

<p>To find ITcl, ITk, and IWidgets, one must go to the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/incrtcl/>
ITcl Project Page</a>.  Even though it was compiled for Tcl/Tk 8.3.2p1, the
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/incrtcl/Mac_Itcl3.1_8.3.2p1.sit.bin">
binary distribution of ITcl/Itk/IWidgets version 3.1</a> works with Tcl/Tk 8.3.4.</p>

<h3>Win32</h3>

<p>For Microsoft Windows computers we selected the <a
href="http://downloads.activestate.com/ActiveTcl/Windows/8.3.4/ActiveTcl8.3.4.2-1-win32-ix86.exe">
ActiveTcl 8.3.4.2</a> distribution from <a
href="http://www.activestate.com/">Activestate</a>.</p>

<p>The only problem with this distribution is that it contains far more than
we need.  It consumes about 24 Megabytes of disk space and takes a fairly
long time to install.</p>

<h2>Connecting Interpreter and Scripts</h2>

<p>The first area of incompatibility between platforms involves how scripts
are run.</p>

<h3>Unix</h3>

<p>On Unix and Unix-like systems such as BSD and Linux things work fairly well.
Any modern operating system of this family supports the #! comment at the top
of the script file as a way to specify the interpreter.

<h3>Win32</h3>

<p>Things are not quite so bright on Microsoft Windows machines.  You
basically have two choices.  One, you can rely on the operating system's
file extension handling.  Generally this will be set up so that .tcl files
are run by Wish, though it is difficult to know if it will be the copy of
Wish that you expected it to be.  The other is that you can create a
shortcut that explicitly invokes the Wish interpreter you want with the
script name as a command line argument.

<h3>MacOS</h3>

<p>It is most unclear to us what is the normal way to run Tcl scripts under
MacOS.  What we did discover was that we could make a copy of Wish, open it
in Resedit, and paste the script into a Text resource with ID number ????. 
There is even a little program that will do this for you.</p>

<p>Of course, every script done this way requires an extra copy of Wish,
which eats up a few hundred kilobytes of hard disk space.  It would be worse
if it were not for the fact that a good deal of Tcl and Tk are in two
dynamicly linked libraries.</p>

<h2>Application Configuration Files</h2>
