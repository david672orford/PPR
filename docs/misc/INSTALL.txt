This document describes the steps required to compile and install PPR.  See
README.txt to learn where the other documentation is.

This document does not discuss installing PPR from an .rpm file.  The RPM
version of PPR is still considered experimental.

=============================================================================
 Requirements for Installing PPR
=============================================================================

1) The PPR source archive (ppr-1.50.tar.gz)

2) Gunzip (to uncompress the source archive)

3) Tar (to unpack the source archive)

4) GCC version 2.5.8 or later or the native C compiler on
   DEC OSF/1, Digital Unix 4.0, or IRIX 6.3.

5) GNU dbm (GDBM) 1.5 or 1.7 and possibly other versions

All of these items are probably already installed on Linux systems.  For
other systems, you should check first.  The version of GCC may be
determined with the command "gcc -v".

It is possible to compile and use PPR even if you don't have GDBM, but
the ppuser command and the printer accounting features associated with it
won't work.

While Perl is not absolutely required to use PPR, it is strongly recomended
that you install Perl 5.005 or later.

If you do not have Perl 4.036 or later, the following things will not work:

* The TeX filter.  This means that you will have to run TeX source files
  through TeX or LaTeX before sending them to be printed.  (But, the DVI
  filter will still work.)

* The "atalk" responder and its daemon "atalkmapd".  (Which hardly work
  at all anyway.)

* Automatic Windows 95 driver installation for Samba.

If your Perl is older than 5.005, these additional things won't work:

* The experimental World Wide Web interface.

* The experimental ppr-panel GUI (which also requires Perl/Tk).

* The audio commentator and responder.

=============================================================================
 Programs for PostScript Filters
=============================================================================

If the following software is present, more input filters will be available:

* NetPBM

* djpeg

* Groff or Troff

* TeX/LaTeX

* Perl 4.0 patch level 36 or Perl 5.005 (Other versions not tested.)

* DVIPS

* plot2ps (Available from ftp://ppr-dist/pub/ppr/)

* Transfig

* GNU Texinfo

* Uncompress

* GZIP

* HTMLDOC (Available from http://www.easysw.com/~mike/htmldoc/)

* Xpdf

* Adobe Acrobat Reader

Most of these programs are a standard component of many Linux distributions.

=============================================================================
 Notes for CAP
=============================================================================

If you will be using PPR with CAP and you will be sharing more than about 10
printers using papsrv, you must change two values in a CAP library header
file and re-compile the CAP library.

You should go to the directory "cap60/lib/cap" and edit the file "abpap.h".
Change the values in the defines of NUMPAP and NUMSPAP from their normal
values of 12 and 10 respectively to something higher such as 70 and 70.
Once you have made the change you must re-compile and re-install the CAP
library by running "make install".

You must also copy a header file from a CAP source directory to
"/usr/include/netat" (or wherever your CAP netat/ include directory is).  The
file is the one you may have edited in the procedure described above,
"cap60/lib/cap/abpap.h".

=============================================================================
 Notes for Netatalk
=============================================================================

In order to use Netatalk with PPR you must first obtain and install NATALI,
the Netatalk AppleTalk Library Interface compatibility library.  This
library, written by the author of PPR, may be obtained from the same place
you got PPR.

NATALI only works with Linux, though it is probably possible to port it to
other operating systems without a lot of trouble.

NOTE: be sure to read the README.txt file that comes with NATALI.  If you
don't follow the directions, there will be an unresolved symbol when you try
to link a program with NATALI and Netatalk.

=============================================================================
 Notes for RedHat Linux 4.x
=============================================================================

In 4.0 release, the file /usr/include/libintl.h contains an appearent bug.
The line "#include <locale.h>" is enclosed by "#ifdef HAVE_LOCALE_H" and
"#endif".  The condition should be removed.  It is not known if this problem
is present in 4.1 or 4.2.

If you want international messages support, then after you have run Configure
and said "yes" to the appropriate option you must edit makeprogs/global.mk and
change the line which says:

INTLLIBS=#-lintl

to

INTLLIBS=-lintl

Configure does not put the option -lintl in because the file /usr/lib/libintl.a
is not present in RedHat 5.1 or 5.2.  Worse yet, if you upgrade a 4.x system
to 5.1 the old file will be left in place.  Linking against the old file will
result in executables that fail and dump core.

=============================================================================
 Notes for DEC OSF/1
=============================================================================

I believe these steps are not needed for PPR 1.40 or later.  If you have definite
information on this point, write to <ppr-bugs@mail.trincoll.edu>.

Installing PPR on DEC OSF/1 systems is straightforward.  The only
required system modification is to insure that the System V STREAMS
based modules are built into the kernel.

You should find kernel configuration parameters in the file
/sys/conf/HOSTNAME.  Examine the file and determine if the following
lines are present.

options		STREAMS
options         FFM_FS
options         PCKT

If the above are present all the necessary components are already in place.
Otherwise, you will need to rebuild the OS kernel using /usr/sbin/doconfig 
as root.  In the doconfig script you will be asked to select kernel options.
Be sure to include the following: System V Devices, STREAMS, and File on File
Filesystem.  When doconfig finishes copy the new kernel to /vmunix and reboot.

From this point on, you should be able to follow the usual PPR
installation procedures.  When you run Configure, it will give you
the option of using the C compiler that comes with the operating system.

=============================================================================
 Notes for SGI IRIX 6.3
=============================================================================

If you want to use lprsrv, then you must make lpsched stop binding to the lpd
port.  To do this, add -nobsd to the line in /etc/init.d/lp that starts
lpsched.

=============================================================================
 Notes for HP-UX 10.20
=============================================================================

When the xwin responder pops up an xterm with a message in it, you may find
that the close button does not work.  This is apparently due to a bug in
xterm.

If this happens to you, you might want to install Tcl/Tk and the xmessage
script described in the "X-Windows" section of this document.

It is reported that CAP60 AppleTalk support works.

=============================================================================
 Notes for ULTRIX
=============================================================================

This port is still inmature, so there are still problems.

The /bin/sh supplied with this system is very old.  It does not support
shell functions.  Fortunately, a more modern shell is supplied as /bin/sh5.
The Configure script uses shell functions.  So, to run it you must use
the command "sh5 Configure" rather than "./Configure".

This operating system may be missing the header files <sys/bitypes.h> and
<sys/cdefs.h>.  If so, try the following:

Link sys/bitypes.h to types.h and made a dummy sys/cdefs.h:
  #define __BEGIN_DECLS
  #define __P(x) x
  #define __END_DECLS

You may also notice that compiling with GCC is not an option.  If one does,
seteuid() and setegid() don't work correctly.  (They don't work perfectly
with the bundled compiler either, but they are better.)  Presumably there
is a way to fix this.

The bundled compiler may have trouble compiling the Flex generated PPD
file lexers.  If it does, do "make veryclean" in the /pprdrv/ and /papsrv/
directories.  After this is done, the lexer code will be re-generated with
Lex.  Using Lex should be avoided because Lex generated lexers may not work
correctly with *Include: in PPD files.

=============================================================================
 Notes for MS-Windows NT 4.0 and UWIN 2.0
=============================================================================

This port is new, so there are still problems.  These instructions are
out-of-date.

You will probably have to use the GUI tools to create the user "ppr".  Since
NT does not allow a group with the same name, after running Configure, you
will have to edit makeprogs/global.mk and change GROUP_PPR to something else
and uncomment the line below its definition.

=============================================================================
 Notes for MS-Windows NT 4.0 and Cygwin
=============================================================================

This port is barely functional or non-functional.  You will probably have to
make some adjustments to the section in sysdep.h or global.mk.  The install
may also require some manual intervention.  This is not for the
inexperienced user!

=============================================================================
 Notes X-Windows
=============================================================================

If your X-Windows distribution does not include xmessage, but you have Tcl/Tk,
then you can install the xmessage clone from the misc/ directory.  You should
probably put it in the /usr/bin/X11 directory.  This script is not a perfect
clone but it is good enough for PPR's purposes

=============================================================================
 Simple Compiling Instructions
=============================================================================

1) Become root.

2) Unpack the PPR source archive in a suitable place.
   "/usr/local/src" is good.  You can do this with these commands:

   mkdir /usr/local/src
   cd /usr/local/src
   gunzip -c ppr-1.44.tar.gz | tar -xvf -

3) Change directory to "ppr-1.50" and run "./Configure".  Answer the questions.

4) Run "make" and then "make install".

5) Run fixup.  (Make install will tell you the full path.)

If you have problems building PPR and want to delve into the Makefiles, you
should probably read PORTING.txt first.

============================================================================
 Making Binary Distributions
============================================================================

If you are compiling a binary distribution of PPR, such as an RPM, you can
use the variable RPM_BUILD_ROOT to control where "make install" installs
PPR.  If this environment variable is set, then its contents will be
prepended to all install paths.  The sample ppr.spec uses this feature.

============================================================================
 Upgrading to PPR 1.50 from previous versions
============================================================================

This is a list of important changes you should be aware of when upgrading
from a prevous version of PPR.  Previous versions include 1.44, 1.43, 1.42, 
1.41, 1.40, 1.32, 1.31, 1.20, 1.10, and 1.00.

It is hard to keep track of what has changed.  If, when upgrading, you find
things I have omitted, please write to <ppr-bugs@mail.trincoll.edu>.

I have tried to list the changes from newest to oldest.  You can stop
reading the information no longer applies to the version you are upgrading
from.

As much as possible, the fixup script tries to make upgrading painless,
however some things might have to be fixed manually.  This section will at
least give you some idea of what fixup will be doing.

1) The defaults which the ./Configure script uses for the install
directories changed with version 1.41.  Formerly PPR was installed in
/usr/ppr, /etc/ppr, and /var/spool/ppr.  Now it is installed in
/usr/lib/ppr, /usr/share/ppr, /etc/ppr, and /var/spool/ppr.  This change
was made in order to conform to the File System Hierarcy Standard.

If you are upgrading from an earlier version of PPR, you may wish to manually 
enter the old directory locations.  Alternatively, you can rename /usr/ppr
to /usr/ppr_old (so you won't later mistakenly look for something there) and
then move /usr/ppr/speach (if you have it installed) to /usr/share/ppr/speach.
You should also change the PPR home directory to /usr/lib/ppr and move anything
else you put in /usr/ppr (such as PPD files, .k5login, .profile, etc.) into 
either /usr/lib/ppr or /usr/share/ppr.

2) The version 1.50 queue file format differs from all previous versions.
Therefor, you should empty the queues before upgrading.

3) Be aware that certain files formerly in /etc/ppr and /usr/ppr/globalconf
have been moved to /usr/ppr/lib (which itself become /usr/lib/ppr/lib with
version 1.42).  They all have the extension ".conf".  They were moved first
to /usr/ppr/globalconf in version 1.32 and then to /usr/ppr/lib in version 
1.40 because they are really a more a part of the PPR code than a user 
configuration file.  If you have made changes to any of these files, you 
should save them before upgrading since PPR will remove those in 
/usr/ppr/globalconf.  Those in /etc/ppr will be renamed to include strings
such as "pre-1.32" indicating in which PPR version they became obsolete.

4) Starting with version 1.32, the file /etc/ppr/lw_messages.conf has been split
into two files, which in version 1.40 are called /usr/ppr/lib/lw-messages.conf
and /etc/ppr/lw-messages.conf.  Unknown messages are now appended to the one
in /etc/ppr, the one in /usr/ppr/lib is never modified.

5) If you have been using the UPRINT system in 1.31 (in which it existed in an
early form) or one of the 1.32 beta releases then you may have some work to do.
The names of the uprint programs have changed.  The names to which the standard
spooler programs are renamed have also changed.  You should probably copy
/etc/ppr/uprint.conf.sample to /etc/ppruprint.conf and manually rename things
so that your file system matches your uprint.conf file.

6) If you are upgrading from 1.30 then you need to know that the lprsrv program
has changed.  The old program is preserved as olprsrv.  If you are in a
hurry you can edit /etc/inetd.conf and change "lprsrv" to "olprsrv".  To
install the new one, follow the directions in the lprsrv(8) man page
for creating an entry in /etc/inetd.conf and then edit the lprsrv.conf
file.

7) As of PPR version 1.30, the PPD file "HP LJ III Ghostscript" is called "HP
LaserJet III Ghostscript".  You are advised to delete the old one (which
will not have been removed) and use "ppad ppd" to change printers to use the
new one.

8) If you are using Samba, you can still use the pseudo-printcap method of
importing PPR printers, but it would be better to use the new method described
in the ppr2samba(8) man page since it obviates the need to restart smbd
after running ppr2samba.

9) Because the name of the papsrv configuration file changed in version 1.30,
if you start papsrv with commands in /etc/rc.local or /etc/rc.d/rc.local then
you must change the test for the presence of the papsrv configuration file.
Where it previously said:

if [ -x /usr/ppr/bin/papsrv -a -r /etc/ppr/papsrv ]

it should now say:

if [ -x /usr/ppr/bin/papsrv -a -r /etc/ppr/papsrv.conf ]

If your system uses System V style init scripts (not just a System V style
init) then you don't have to do anything.  A new PPR start/stop script will
be installed.

10) Version 1.30 and later versions install a System V style init startup
script for PPR on some systems for which earlier versions appended lines
to rc.local.  If the fixup script installs an init script on your system and
finds evidence of PPR startup code in rc.local it will alert you to that
fact and recomend that you removed the startup code from rc.local.

11) With version 1.30, the names of a few configuration files in /etc/ppr
changed.  The fixup script will rename your old ones.  This chart describes
the changes:

Old Name	  New Name	  Old File Renamed To
----------------------------------------------------
papsrv		| papsrv.conf	| papsrv.conf
fontsub		| fontsub.conf	| fontsub-pre-1.30.conf
mfmodes		| mfmodes.conf	| mfmodes-pre-1.30.conf
media		| media.db	| media-pre-1.30.db

If you have made changes to any of the last three files you may want to
put your own version back or merge your changes into the new one.  As
explained above, in version 1.32, mfmodes.conf and fontsub.conf
were moved to /usr/ppr/globalconf.  In version 1.40 they were moved
to /usr/ppr/lib.

12) The format of the mfmodes.conf file changed slightly with version 1.30.
It now has a new field which is compared to *DefaultResolution.  When
converting entries from the old format, insert a new fourth field with a
value of "*".

13) The default path for Ghostscript used by interface programs such as
gssimple, gsatalk, and gstcpip is defined in /etc/ppr/ppr.conf.
Prior to version 1.30 it was "/usr/local/bin/gs" and could not be changed.
The default may be overridden with the "gs=" interface option.

14) In version 1.30 the interface "parallel" was renamed to "simple".  This
was to prepare for a new interface called "parallel" which appeared
in version 1.32.  The interface "gs" was also renamed, to "gssimple".  This
was in anticipation of an interface called "gsparallel" which also appeared
in version 1.32 and is expected to marginalize gssimple.  If you have
print queues which use the "gs" interface, you will have to switch them to
the "gssimple" or "gsparallel" interface.

15) Starting with version 1.20 PPR provides default filter options which are
prepended to those supplied with the ppr -o switch.  The list of these
options is stored in the printer or group configuration file.  Pre-1.20
configuration files won't have "DefFiltOpts:" lines.  To generate them, run
these commands:

$ cd /etc/ppr/printers
$ for i in *
> do
> ppad deffiltopts $i
> done
$ cd /etc/ppr/groups
$ for i in *
> do
> ppad group deffiltopts $i
> done

This will generate a new "DefFiltOpts:" line in each printer and group
configuration file.

16) The names of the groups which are used to grant PPR privledges changed
with version 1.20.  You should use the following information to rename you
groups:

    The privledge of using the ppr -f switch to appear to be somebody else
    now belongs to the members of "pprprox".  Previously the members of
    "ppr" could also do this.  (Do not delete the group "ppr".)

    The privledge of making changes with ppop now belongs to the members
    of the group "ppop" rather than "ppr".  (Do not delete the group
    "ppr").

    The privledge of making changes with ppad now belongs to the members
    of the group "ppad" rather than "ppradmin".

Note that the use of Unix groups to grant PPR privledges is considered
obsolete.  The new way to do it is to list the privledged users in
the file in /etc/ppr/acl.  So, you may just want to remove your
administrators from the "ppr" group, delete the "ppradmin" group,
and start using the /etc/ppr/acl files.
