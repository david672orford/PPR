<Title>Requirements for a Responder</Title>

<Para>
A responder is a small program.  All responders are stored in the responders
directory <Literal remap="tt">/usr/ppr/responders</Literal>.  The responder which will eventually be
used to tell the user what happened to the job is selected when the job is
submitted.  It is selected using <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis>'s <Emphasis remap="bf">-m</Emphasis>. switch.  The argument to
the <Emphasis remap="bf">-m</Emphasis> switch is the name of the program in the responders directory which
should be used.  A responder can be very simple.  Here is an example:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
#!/bin/sh
echo "Message for $1:\n$3" | write $2
exit 0
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
The responder shown above is a stript down version of the responder <Emphasis remap="bf">write</Emphasis>.
If the <Emphasis remap="bf">-m</Emphasis> switch is not used then the name of the responder will be read
from the environment variable PPR&lowbar;RESPONDER.  If PPR&lowbar;RESPONDER is not defined
then the responder <Emphasis remap="bf">write</Emphasis> will be used.
</Para>

<Para>
A responder program is invoked with the name of the user as the first
parameter.  It is the name just as it appears in queue listings and on banner
pages.
</Para>

<Para>
The address to which the message should be sent is the second parameter.  The
address is specified at the time <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> is invoked by using the <Emphasis remap="bf">-r</Emphasis>
switch.  The proper format for the address depends on the responder.  If the
<Emphasis remap="bf">-r</Emphasis> switch is absent then the value of the environment variable
PPR&lowbar;RESPONDER&lowbar;ADDRESS is used.  If that too is absent then the name of the Unix
user who invoked <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> is used.  The value used in the absence of both
<Emphasis remap="bf">-r</Emphasis> and PPR&lowbar;RESPONDER&lowbar;ADDRESS is appropriate since the default responder is
a script which invokes the Unix program <Emphasis remap="bf">write</Emphasis>.
</Para>

<Para>
The third parameter is the suggested message text.  The message text will
contain embedded line feeds.  The length of the lines will depend on the
responder.  The routine get&lowbar;responder&lowbar;width() in <Literal remap="tt">libppr/reswidth.c</Literal>
determines what length to limit the lines to.  For most responders, this
routine returns 0 which means to use a predetermined set of line breaks which
generally results in lines less than 80 characters long.
</Para>

<Para>
The fourth parameter is reserved for future use, at present it is an empty
string.
</Para>

<Para>
The fifth parameter is a space separated list of responder options.  Each of
this options is a name=value pair.  Common options include <Emphasis remap="bf">printed=no</Emphasis> and
<Emphasis remap="bf">timeout=60</Emphasis>.  The value of this option comes from the <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis>
<Emphasis remap="bf">--responder-options</Emphasis> switch or from the environment variable
PPR&lowbar;RESPONDER&lowbar;OPTIONS.  A responder should ignore any options it does not
recognize.
</Para>

<Para>
The sixth parameter is a code number which represents the approximate content
of the message.  It is provided in case a responder wants to send different
types of message by different methods or wishes to provide its own wording for
one or more of the messages.  For example, it might want to send a popup
message but then follow it up with email if the message indicated that the job
was arrested.  The code numbers are defined in C include file
<Literal remap="tt">include/respond.h</Literal>, the Bourne shell script include file
<Literal remap="tt">lib/respond.sh</Literal>, and the Perl include file <Literal remap="tt">lib/respond.ph</Literal>.
</Para>

<Para>
The seventh parameter contains the complete job id.  This is probably only
useful if the responder is constructing its own messages since the default
messages provided in the third parameter already mention the job id.  The job
id is not provided in the normal form since that is rather difficult to parse.
In stead, the elements are separated by spaces.  The elements are, in order,
destination node, <Emphasis remap="it">destination name</Emphasis>, <Emphasis remap="it">queue id number</Emphasis>, <Emphasis remap="it">sub id
number</Emphasis>, and <Emphasis remap="it">home node</Emphasis>.  For example, ``mouse chipmunk 1000 0 mouse''.
This id would normally appear as ``mouse:chipmunk-1000.0(mouse)'' or more
likely in abreviated form as ``chipmunk-1000''.
</Para>

<Para>
The eight parameter is also necessary for constructing replacement messages.
Some of the messages normally contain a blank space which is filled with a
piece of text.  Normally this is the name of the printer which the job was
printed on, but if the user database is being used and PPR refuses access the
the printer, the piece of text is the name of the user who was refused access.
At other times the piece of text will be an error message.
</Para>

<Para>
The ninth parameter is the title of the job.  This title will be derived from a
"&percnt;&percnt;Title:" line if present.  Failing that, the title will be the
name of the file being printed.  If the file was received on stdin, this field
will generally be blank.
</Para>

<Para>
The tenth parameter is the time at which the job was submitted.  It is
represented in Unix format (as a count of the seconds since 12:00am, January
1, 1970).  The program <Emphasis remap="bf">lib/time&lowbar;elapsed</Emphasis> may be used to express this
time in terms of how far in the past it is.
</Para>

<Para>
The eleventh parameter will contain a short message which indicates the
reason the job was arrested.  If the response code does not indicated that
the job has been arrested, this string will be blank.
</Para>

<Para>
The twelth parameter contains the number of pages printed.  If this is unknown,
it is "?".  If the response code (the fourth parameter) has a value other than
<Emphasis remap="bf">RESP&lowbar;FINISHED</Emphasis> then the contents of this field is undefined.
</Para>

<Para>
When the responder is run, stdin with either be connected to <Literal remap="tt">/dev/null</Literal>
or it will be connected to the job's log file.  This is so that the responder
may send the job log back to the user.  Some of the supplied responders exploit
this feature.
</Para>

<Para>
When exiting, the responder should return a value of zero if the message was
delivered.  It should also return a value of zero if the addresse was not
found.  Non-zero exit values should be reserved for truly abnormal conditions
such as insufficient system resources or syntactically invalid addresses.  If a
responder does return a non-zero exit value, <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> will print a notice to
that effect on stderr or <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis> will put a notice in its log file, depending
on which one invoked the responder.
</Para>

<Para>
When the responder is invoked by <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis>, it will always have a real uid,
effective uid and saved uid of ``ppr''.  When it is invoked by <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> (due to
the use of the <Emphasis remap="bf">-e</Emphasis> responder option) things will be different.  The program
<Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> is setuid ``ppr'', so the effective and saved uids are ``ppr'' and the
real uid is the id of the user who invoked it.  Just before executing the
responder <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> sets the effective user id equal to the real user id.  This
last feature is not intended as a security measure, rather, the <Emphasis remap="bf">xwin</Emphasis>
responder will not work if this is not done since the X library uses access()
on the .Xauthority file before trying to open it which means that the
.Xauthority file in the user's home directory must be readable under both the
real and the effective uids.  This feature may be overridden by setting the
setuid bit on the responder.  If this is done then the effective uid will remain
``ppr''.
</Para>
