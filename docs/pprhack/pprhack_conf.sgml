<Title>Configuration File Formats</Title>

<Para>
Configuration files which the system administrator is expected to modify
directly are described within the reference manual.  The files described
in this section are modified automatically by programs such as ppad.  That
is why they are described here in the Hacker's Guide.
</Para>

<Sect2 id="printer-config">
<Title>Format of a Printer Configuration File</Title>

<Para>Each file in the directory <Filename
class="Directory">/etc/ppr/printers/</Filename> represents one printer.  It
is permissible to create and edit these files manually, however the command
<Command>ppad</Command> has been provided to do this automatically.</Para>

<Para>A new printer configuration file is created by the <command>ppad
interface</command> command. The new configuration file is created by
turning the arguments of the <command>ppad interface</command> command into
a <Literal>Interface:</Literal> and an <Literal>Address:</Literal> line and
appending the file <Filename>/etc/ppr/newprn.conf</Filename>. The
<Filename>newprn.conf</Filename> file is normally created by the
<Command>ppad new alerts</Command> command.</Para>

<Para>Any lines begining with <Literal>;</Literal> or <Literal>#</Literal> are comments.  Blank lines
are ignored.  All other lines should begin with a keyword which is followed
by one or more values.  Only the <Literal>Bin:</Literal> and
<Literal>PPDOpt:</Literal> lines should occur more than once.  If any other
line occurs multiple times, all but the last instance are ignored.</Para>

<Para>
Any line that begins with an unrecognized keyword is ignored.  This is so that
you can add lines of your own which will be understood and acted on by other
programs.  The program <Command>ppr2samba</Command> works on this principle.
</Para>

<VariableList>

<VarListEntry>
<Term><Literal>Comment:</Literal> <Replaceable>string</Replaceable></Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
This line contains a comment which describes the printer. The comment is
displayed when the <Command>ppad show</Command> command is used to display the printer
configuration.  This line is optional.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term><Literal>Interface:</Literal> <Replaceable>interface</Replaceable></Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
This line is required.  It gives the name of the program which the spooler
should invoke in order to make contact with the printer.  If the
<Replaceable>interface</Replaceable> does not
begin with a slash, then it refers to a subdirectory of the
<Filename class="Directory">/usr/lib/ppr/interfaces/</Filename> directory.
Common values for this line are <Literal>atalk</Literal>,
<Literal>tcpip</Literal>, and <Literal>serial</Literal>.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term><Literal>Address:</Literal> <Replaceable>address_string</Replaceable></Term>
<ListItem>

<Para>The address string is passed to the interface program as its second
parameter. The proper format for this string depends on the interface. 
Reasonable values for use with the interfaces named in the above paragraph
are <Literal>Mac Laser Printer: LaserWriter@MYZONE</Literal>,
<Literal>smith.prn.myorg.org:9100</Literal>, and
<Literal>/dev/ttys05</Literal>.  If the address contains leading or trailing
spaces it should be enclosed in double quotes.  Technically, this line is
not required, but the default address is the name of the printer which is
unlikely to be useful.</Para>

</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term><Literal>Options:</Literal> <Replaceable>string</Replaceable></Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
This line is optional.  The value <Replaceable>string</Replaceable> is passed to the
interface as its third parameter.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term><Literal>PPDFile:</Literal> <Replaceable>filename</Replaceable></Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
This line specifies the path and name of an Adobe Post Script Printer
Description file which describes the printer.  If the name does not begin with
a slash, it referes to a file in the directory <Filename class="Directory">/usr/lib/ppr/PPDFiles</Filename>.
This line may not be required but it really ought to be present.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term><Literal>Alert:</Literal> <Replaceable>interval</Replaceable> <Replaceable>method</Replaceable> <Replaceable>address</Replaceable></Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
This line is optional.  If it is present, then messages will be sent to the
designated person when faults occur on the printer.
</Para>
<Para>
The integer <Replaceable>interval</Replaceable> indicates how often these messages will be sent.
For instance, if the value is <Literal>5</Literal>, then a message will be sent for every 5th
fault.
</Para>
<Para>
The <Replaceable>method</Replaceable> parameter indicates the method by which the message should be
sent.  Currently, this parameter is ignored.  Set it to <Literal>mail</Literal>.
</Para>
<Para>
The <Replaceable>address</Replaceable> indicates the person to whom the message should be sent.
Since <Literal>mail</Literal> is currently the only supported method, this should be a
e-mail address.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term><Literal>FlagPages:</Literal> <Replaceable>integer</Replaceable> <Replaceable>integer</Replaceable></Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
This line is optional.  The first integer refers to banner pages, the second
to trailer pages.  Four different values are allowed.  They are
<Literal>0</Literal> for
'never', <Literal>1</Literal> for 'preferably not', <Literal>2</Literal> for
'preferably yes', and
<Literal>3</Literal> for 'always'.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term><Literal>Feedback:</Literal> <Replaceable>boolean</Replaceable></Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
This line is optional.  It indicates whether or not the connexion to the
printer allows it to send messages back to the spooler.  There is a list of
default values for all the interfaces supplied with PPR compiled into
<Command>pprdrv</Command>.  (This list is defined in <Filename
class="HeaderFile">include/interfaces.h</Filename>.)  If this
line is not present and the interface is not in the list, it is assumed to be
<Literal>false</Literal>.  Any instances of this line which occur before the
<Literal>Interface:</Literal>
line are ignored.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term><Literal>JobBreak:</Literal> <Replaceable>integer</Replaceable></Term>
<ListItem>

<Para>This line is optional.  The integer is the code number of a job break
method. This line is only necessary if a job break method other than the
default for the interface is desired.  Default job break numbers for the
interfaces which come with PPR are defined in the source file <Filename
class="HeaderFile">include/interfaces.h</Filename>. The meaning of the
values in <Filename class="HeaderFile">interfaces.h</Filename> can be
understood by reading the <Command>ppad jobbreak</Command> section of 
<ULink url="../refman/ppad.8.html">the ppad(8) man page</ULink>.
Any instances of this line which occur before the <Literal>Interface:</Literal> line are
ignored.</Para>

</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term><Literal>Codes:</Literal> <Replaceable>integer</Replaceable></Term>
<ListItem>

<Para>This line is optional.  It indicates the range of character codes
which the interface can transmit to the printer.  The acceptable values are
<Literal>1</Literal> for Clean7Bit, <Literal>2</Literal> for Clean8Bit,
<Literal>3</Literal> for Binary and <Literal>4</Literal> for Binary if TBCP
is used.</Para>

</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term><Literal>GrayOK:</Literal> <Replaceable>boolean</Replaceable></Term>
<ListItem>

<Para>This line is optional.  The default value is <Literal>true</Literal>.  If this parameter is
set to <Literal>false</Literal>, the printer will refuse to print any job which does not have
<Literal>color</Literal> in a <Literal>%%Requirements:</Literal> line in its header.
A <Literal>GrayOK:</Literal>
line can be used to prevent black-and-white or grayscale jobs from begin
printed on an expensive colour printer.</Para>

</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term><Literal>Charge:</Literal> <Replaceable>money</Replaceable> [<Replaceable>money</Replaceable>]</Term>
<ListItem>

<Para>This line is optional.  If this line is present, then the printer
becomes a protected printer.  Each parameter
<Replaceable>money</Replaceable> will normally be a positive number with two
decimal places.  If both are <Literal>0.00</Literal>, then the printer is
protected, but no actual charges are mode to the user's account.  The first
number is the amount that should be charged for each sheet of paper printed
on both sides. The second is the amount that should be charged for each
sheet printed on only one side.  If the second number is missing it is
assumed to be the same as the first.</Para>

</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term><Literal>OutputOrder:</Literal> <Replaceable>direction</Replaceable></Term>
<ListItem>

<Para>This line is optional.  If it is absent, it is assumed that direction
is <Literal>Normal</Literal>.  If direction is set to
<Literal>Reverse</Literal>, the spooler will cause the pages to be printed
in reverse order, if possible.  The value of this line can be set with the
command <Command>ppad outputorder printer Normal</Command>, <Command>ppad
outputorder printer Reverse</Command>, or <Command>ppad outputorder printer
ppd</Command>.  The command <Command>ppad outputorder printer ppd</Command>
deletes any <Literal>OutputOrder:</Literal> line which may exist.</Para>

</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term><Literal>Bin:</Literal> <Replaceable>binname</Replaceable></Term>
<ListItem>

<Para>The <Replaceable>binname</Replaceable> parameter is the bin name as it
appears in a <Literal>*InputSlot</Literal> line of the PPD
file.  Common values are <Literal>Upper</Literal>, <Literal>Lower</Literal>, and
<Literal>Cassette</Literal>.  If
automatic bin selection and media handling are desired, there should be one
<Literal>Bin:</Literal> line for each installed bin.  Removing
all the <Literal>Bin:</Literal> lines disables automatic bin
selection and media handling.</Para>

</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term><Literal>DefFiltOpts:</Literal> <Replaceable>options</Replaceable></Term>
<ListItem>

<Para>This line is optional.  If present, it contains input filter options
in the form of name-value pairs.  (If the user employs one or more
<Option>-o</Option> switches when submitting a job with
<Command>ppr</Command>, then the argument of each <Option>-o</Option> switch
is appended to this list.  Thus, <Option>-o</Option> switches can be used to
override settings in this list.) This line is automatically updated whenever
the <Command>ppad ppd</Command> command is used to select a new PPD file or
the <Command>ppad ppdopts</Command> command is used to change the PPD
options.  An update may be forced at any time with the <Command>ppad
deffiltopts</Command> command.</Para>

</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term><Literal>Switchset:</Literal> <Replaceable>switch_description</Replaceable></Term>
<ListItem>

<Para>This line is optional.  If present, it contains a compressed
description of the switch settings which were saved with the <Command>ppad
switchset</Command> command.</Para>

</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term><Literal>PassThru:</Literal> <Replaceable>typelist</Replaceable></Term>
<ListItem>

<Para>This line is optional.  If present, it contains a space separated list
of file types which should be passed directly through to the printer.</Para>

</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term><Literal>PagesLimit:</Literal> <Replaceable>integer</Replaceable></Term>
<ListItem>

<Para>This line is optional.  If present it indicates the maximum number of
pages this printer is allowed to print in a single job.  Jobs with more
pages than the number indicated are rejected.  If the job was submitted to a
group, it may be printed on another member of the group.  If no printer will
print it, then it is arrested.</Para>

<Para>This line may be edited with the <Command>ppad pageslimit</Command>
command.</Para>

</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term><Literal>PageCountQuery:</Literal> <Replaceable>integer</Replaceable></Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
This line can be used to enable pair of queries which fetch the printers
lifetime page count before and after the printing of the job (exclusive
of banner and trailer pages).
</Para>
<Para>
The information obtained through these queries can be logged.  See Section
<XRef linkend="printlog"/>.
</Para>
<Para>
If this line is absent or the <Replaceable>integer</Replaceable> is 0, then this feature is disabled.
</Para>
<Para>
If the value is 1, then then the PostScript code
<Command>statusdict /pagecount get exec ==</Command> is used to get the page count.  No
attempt is made to make sure that the print engine has come to a stop and the
printer has updated the count before making the query.  On some printers this
does not cause a problem because the page count is updated imediately.  On
others it may be solved by using the <Literal>pjl</Literal> or <Literal>signal/pjl</Literal> jobbreak
method which causes PPR to wait until all of the pages have hit the
output bin before considering the job complete.
</Para>
<Para>
In the future, additional values for this parameter may be defined.  These
additional values will use different techniques to obtain the page count.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term><Literal>Commentator:</Literal> <Replaceable>number name address options</Replaceable></Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
A printer configuration file may have zero or more of these lines.  Their
purpose is explained in Appendix <XRef linkend="commentators"/>.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</VarListEntry>

<VarListEntry>
<Term><Literal>PPDOpt:</Literal> <Replaceable>option value</Replaceable> (<Replaceable>description</Replaceable>)</Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>
A printer configuration file may have zero or more of these lines.  Each line
describes the setting of the options listed in the PPD file.  These settings
generally describe optional equipment which may be installed in or attatched to
the printer such as additional paper trays or duplex attachements.  The
<Replaceable>option</Replaceable> is the option name from the PPD file, without the translation
string (the part which may follow a slash).  The <Replaceable>value</Replaceable> is one of the
possible option values listed  in the PPD file, again without the translation
string.  The description is formed by combining the translation strings for the
option and the value.  (Option settings and the related terminology are
explained in Adobe's PostScript Printer Description File Format
Specification.)  These lines can be generated automatically with the <Command>ppad
ppdopts</Command> command.

<Title>Format of a Group Configuration File</Title>

<Para>
Each file in the <Filename class="Directory">/etc/ppr/groups/</Filename> directory represents a group.  It
is permissible to create and edit these files manually, however it is generally
more convient to use the command <Command>ppad</Command> to do it automatically.  The
<Literal>Printer:</Literal> line is the only one which should appear more than once.  If any
other line occurs more than once, all but the last instance are ignored.  Lines
