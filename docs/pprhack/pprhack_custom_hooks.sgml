<title>Custom Hooks</title>

<para>Custom hooks is a small program which <application>PPR</application>
runs at predetermined points in the process of sending a job to a printer. 
Anything that the program sends to standard output will be transmitted to
the printer.  The program has access to the queue file, so it can determine
the characteristics of the job.  For example, you could write a custom hook
program which printed a banner page.  If a print queue is properly
configured, your program will be used to print banner pages instead of
<application>PPR</application>'s internal banner page printing code.</para>
