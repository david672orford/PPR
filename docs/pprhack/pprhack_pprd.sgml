<Title>Protocol for Comunicating with <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis></Title>

<Para>
This section describes the protocol which use commands such as <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis>,
<Emphasis remap="bf">ppop</Emphasis>, and <Emphasis remap="bf">ppad</Emphasis> use to communicate with <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis> and <Emphasis remap="bf">rpprd</Emphasis>.
This information may assist those attempting to understand the source code.
</Para>

<Para>
The main printing daemon, <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis> receives commands over a named pipe and
acts on them.  The program <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> uses one such command it sends to <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis>
to tell it that a new jobs has been placed in the queue directories.  The
program <Emphasis remap="bf">ppad</Emphasis> has two such commands which it uses to inform <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis> that
a printer or group configuration file has been modified.  Finally, <Emphasis remap="bf">ppop</Emphasis>
has many commands which it uses to control <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis> or to request information
from it.
</Para>

<Para>
The remote printing daemon, <Emphasis remap="bf">rpprd</Emphasis> will receive commands over a named pipe
of its own.  These commands will be identical in format to those understood by
<Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis>.
</Para>

<Sect2>
<Title>Accepting Jobs</Title>

<Para>
Once the job submission program <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> has created the queue files it
sends a command to <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis> or <Emphasis remap="bf">rpprd</Emphasis> telling it that the job is there and
is ready for printing or transfer to the remote system.  This command takes the
form:
</Para>

<Para>
j <Emphasis remap="it">destination&lowbar;node destination&lowbar;queue id subid home&lowbar;node initial&lowbar;priority</Emphasis>
</Para>

<Para>
The <Emphasis remap="it">destination&lowbar;node</Emphasis> is the node to which the job should be sent.  If the
command is written to <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis>'s named pipe, this field must contain the node
name of the local system.  The <Emphasis remap="it">destination&lowbar;queue</Emphasis> is the name of the print
queue on the destination node.  The <Emphasis remap="it">id</Emphasis> and <Emphasis remap="it">subid</Emphasis> are the queue id and
the job fragment number respectively.  The <Emphasis remap="it">subid</Emphasis> will most often be zero.
The <Emphasis remap="it">home&lowbar;node</Emphasis> is the node name of the system on which the job origionated.
Jobs submitted by the program <Emphasis remap="bf">ppr</Emphasis> to <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis> or <Emphasis remap="bf">rpprd</Emphasis> will always
have the home node name of the local system, but jobs submitted to <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis> by
<Emphasis remap="bf">rpprd</Emphasis> probably will not since it is one of <Emphasis remap="bf">rpprd</Emphasis>'s jobs to accept jobs
from remote systems.
</Para>

<Title>Re-loading Configuration Files</Title>

<Para>
Whenever a printer or group configuration files is modified or a new one
created, <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis> must be directed to read it.  To inform <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis> that it
must read a new or revised printer configuration file, a command line of this
form is sent:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
NP <Emphasis remap="it">printername</Emphasis>
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
To indicate that a group configuration file
must be re-read or that a new group configuration file must be read for the
first time:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
NG <Emphasis remap="it">groupname</Emphasis>
</Screen>

</Para>

<Para>
There will be no acknowledgement of either command.
</Para>

<Title>Yielding Information to <Emphasis remap="bf">ppop</Emphasis></Title>

<Para>
The utility <Emphasis remap="bf">ppop</Emphasis> must communicate with <Emphasis remap="bf">pprd</Emphasis> and <Emphasis remap="bf">rpprd</Emphasis> in
order to list the queue, show the status of printers, mount forms, and do other
tasks.  As work on <Emphasis remap="bf">rpprd</Emphasis> continue, descriptions of the necessary commands
will be added to this document.
